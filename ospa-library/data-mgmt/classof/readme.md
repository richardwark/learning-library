The Labs in this library are intended to be carried out in groups, and as such some of the labs 
must be completed by only one person in the group and only once. Examples are the Autonomous Database creation
and the scaling labs. Other labs such as loading and creating tables can be performed by every group member.
Each lab clearly states at the begining whether the lab is intended to be completed by one member of the 
group or by all members, please make sure to take note and follow that guidance.
The labs are numbered in the order they are intended to be completed. Going through the labs in a different 
order may result in inability to finish the lab and other labs.
