# Introduction

Cloud resources are growing and incredible rates. The raw number of resources to be examined and secured vastly overwhelm most information security teams with their existing processes and tooling. 

Cloud services growth continues to expand and customers need more help from their vendors to apply real security. Oracle alone provides >60 cloud applications and services by itself, and this can present an overwhelming challenge to customers.

Information Security needs are growing. Threats are expanding. More services means more knowledge required to secure them. And the gaps in skills and manpower continues to grow beyond the available expertise available. 

Oracle Cloud Guard is a unified security solution that provides a global and centralized approach to the protection of all of a customersâ€™ assets.  It works to analyze data, detect threats and misconfigurations automatically, then hunt down and kill those security threats without requiring human oversight. Oracle Cloud Guard continuously collects data from every part of the infrastructure and application stack, including audit logs, Oracle Data Safe, Oracle OS Management Service, as well as third-party products. Oracle Cloud Guard proactively detects and stops anomalous activity it identifies, shutting down a malicious instance automatically, and proactively revoking user permissions when it detects anomalous user behavior.
