## STEP 1: Tailoring Detectors

1. We will need the compartment name that you will be using as part of this lab. You can use your **root** compartment or create a new one for this lab purposes. For further information on how to create a compartment, please refer to [Creating an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compartment
