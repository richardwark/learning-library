2. In the main dashboard you will see your environment status and current activities to be remediated. Considering that we have recently created a bucket, seeing the update in the console can take up to 10 minutes.

3. After a few minutes you will see the new alerts being reported. As you can see we can identify the issue rised by the setting in our bucket. You can click on **Problems** on the left-hand side of the screen to further investigate the issue.

4. As you can see, our Bucket public alert is listed as **High** risk level and not as **Critical** as configured by default on the Oracle Managed Detector list.

5. Let's dig into the issue. Click on **Responder Activity** on the left-hand side of the screen. We can easily identify the issue, the resource and the execution status and type. Click on the problem name **Bucket is Public** link.

6. On this page we can see the details about the issue, risk level, status, resource and recommendations. As a Security Analyst you can mark this issue as resolved if you have manually remediated this tasks, or dismiss it if you consider this is a false postive. However; we know that this is a critical exposure, so let's fix it. Click on **Remediate** This will trigger an action and will restore the bucket to private.
