# Access and Configure ODI Instance

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to access an ODI instance using Apache Guacamole and configure ODI Studio

*Estimated Lab Time*: 30 minutes

### Objectives
* Access an ODI Instance through Apache Guacamole
* Configure ODI Studio
* Import Mappings and Run Initial Load
* Test the Environment

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## **STEP 0**: Running your Lab
### Access the graphical desktop
For ease of execution of this workshop, your instance has been pre-configured for remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to login.

1. Launch your browser to the following URL

    ```
    URL: <copy>http://[your instance public-ip address]:8080/guacamole</copy>
    ```

2. Provide login credentials

    ```
    Username: <copy>oracle</copy>
    ```
    ```
    Password: <copy>Guac.LiveLabs_</copy>
    ```

  ![](./images/guacamole-login.png " ")

  *Note:* There is an underscore `_` character at the end of the password.

3. Click on the *Terminal* Desktop icon to open a terminal session

  ![](./images/guacamole-landing.png " ")


4. In the terminal window, run the following initialize and start *ODI Studio* (one-time only)

    ```
    <copy>/home/oracle/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/odi/studio/odi.sh -clean -initialize &</copy>
    ```

  *Note:* If you close *ODI Studio* and need to re-open it, simply click on the desktop icon as show above or re-run the same script with *"-clean -initialize"*. The command above is to be executed one-time only otherwise the client will be re-initialized and any cache saved since your initial run will de discarded.

### Login to Host using SSH Key based authentication
While all command line tasks included in this workshop can be performed from a terminal session from the remote desktop session as shown above, you can optionally use your preferred SSH client.

Refer to *Lab Environment Setup* for detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*
  - OS User – “*oracle*”.

1. First login as “*opc*” using your SSH Private Key

2. Then sudo to “*oracle*”. E.g.

    ```
    <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
    ```

## **STEP 1:** Launch and Configure ODI Studio

1. A user *Oracle* from the remote desktop session you started above, launch a terminal client and Start the container database, all PDB's and the listener

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/scripts/  
    sh ./startup.sh
    </copy>
    ```

  *Note*: You may also run this script from your SSH client if preferred

2. From the same remote desktop session, Click on the "*Oracle Data Integrator*" icon.

## **STEP 2:** Import Mappings and Run Initial Load

1. If you are new to ODI, import these mappings using smart import. Select import to open the import wizard

  ![](./images/odi_studio_4.png " ")  

2. Select "Smart Import" option and click ok.

3.  Enter the path to the **`ODI_Beginner_Labs.xml`** (or) **`ODI_Advance_Labs.xml`** file (`/home/oracle/ODI_Mappings_V1/ODI_Beginner_Labs.xml`) or (`/home/oracle/ODI_Mappings_V1/ODI_Advance_Labs.xml`) and click "Next".

  ![](./images/odi_mapping_1.png " ")  

4. Click "Next" on the next screen, provide the Export key and then click on Finish.
