# Create a Custom Masking Format in Data Safe
## Introduction
Using Data Safe, create a masking format and assign a default masking format to a user-defined sensitive type.

### Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to do the following:
- Create a masking format.
- Assign a default masking format to a user-defined sensitive type.

### Challenge
You have department IDs in your target database that you need to mask. You decide to create a masking format in Oracle Data Safe to mask the data.

Follow these general steps:
1. Sign in to your ATP-D database as the ADMIN user with SQL Developer Web.
2. In SQL Developer Web, research the `DEPARTMENT_ID` column in your target database to help you figure out how to create a masking format for it.
3. Sign in to the Oracle Data Safe Console for your region.
4. In the Oracle Data Safe Console, create a masking format to mask the `HCM1.DEPARTMENT_ID` column in your target database.
5. Select your masking format as the default masking format for the sensitive type that you created in [Discovery Lab 4 - Create a Sensitive Type and Sensitive Category with Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Discovery%20Lab%204.md) (**Custom Department ID Number**).

## STEP 1: Create a custom masking format

Connect to ATP-D DB using SQL Developer Web

Refer Step 5 from [Lab - Assess Users with Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Assessment%20Lab%202.md)

In SQL Developer Web, search the `DEPARTMENT_ID` column in your target database to help you figure out how to create a masking format for it.

- On the SQL Worksheet, run a select on the `DEPARTMENTS` table.
```
<copy>SELECT * FROM HCM1.DEPARTMENTS;</copy>
```
- Notice that the department ID values are 10, 20, 30, up to 270.
- Click the **Data Modeler** tab.

- In the first drop-down list, select `HCM1`.
- In the second drop-down list, select **Tables**.

- Drag the `DEPARTMENTS` table to the worksheet.
- Notice that the `DEPARTMENT_ID` column has the data-type `NUMBER(4)`, which means it can take up to four digits (no decimals). It is also a primary key column.

Sign in to the Oracle Data Safe Console in your region

Refer [Lab - Register a Target Database (ATP-D) with Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Register%20a%20Target%20Database.md)

In the Oracle Data Safe Console, create a masking format to mask department IDs

- In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Library** tab.
- Under **Data Masking**, click **Masking Formats**, and then click **Add**.

- The **Create Masking Format** dialog box is displayed.
- Leave the **Create Like** drop-down list as is.
- In the **Masking Format Name** field, enter **<username> Custom Department IDs**.
- In the **Masking Format Description** field, enter **Custom Department IDs**.
- Select your resource group.
- From the Format drop-down list, select **Random Number**.
- In the **Start Number** field, enter **10**.
- In the **End Number** field, enter **9990**.

   ![](./images/Img89.png " ")
- Click **Save**.<br>
A confirmation message states that you successfully created the masking format.
- Move the **Hide Oracle Predefined** slider to the right and verify that your masking format is listed.
