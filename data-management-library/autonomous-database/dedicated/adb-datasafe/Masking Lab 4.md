# Configure a Variety of Masking Formats with Data Safe
## Introduction
Using Data Safe, perform data discovery and data masking in one flow, configure a variety of masking formats, such as random number, fixed string, group shuffle, regular expression, and conditional and pre-defined custom mask.

### Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to do the following:
- Perform data discovery and data masking in one flow.
- Configure a variety of masking formats, such as random number, fixed string, group shuffle, regular expression, and random date.
- Use conditional masking for a masking format.
- Select a predefined and custom masking format for a sensitive type.

### Challenge
You want to discover and mask your sensitive data all within the same flow in Oracle Data Safe. You configure a variety of masking formats, including basic masking formats, predefined masking formats, and the user-defined masking format you created in [Masking Lab 3 - Create a Masking Format in Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Masking%20Lab%203.md).

Follow these general steps:
1. Sign in to the Oracle Data Safe Console for your region.
2. Launch the Data Masking wizard and discover sensitive data in the `HCM1` schema. Select all of the predefined sensitive types and the sensitive type that you created in [Discovery Lab 4 - Create a Sensitive Type and Sensitive Category with Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Discovery%20Lab%204.md). Save your sensitive data model as **<username> SDM3**. Clear all of the selected sensitive columns in the masking policy, and define masking formats only for those listed in steps 3 through 13 below. Save your masking format as **<username> Mask2_HCM1**.
3. Configure a masking format for `EMP_EXTENDED.TAXPAYERID` to generate random numbers between **100,000,000** and **899,999,999**.
4. Configure a masking format for `SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.TAXPAYER_ID` to generate a fixed string `***-**-****`.
5. Configure a masking format for `EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME` to generate a fixed string **< username >_tiger**.
6. Configure a masking format for `LOCATIONS.POSTAL_CODE` to generate 5-digit random numbers between **10000** and **99999**.
7. Configure a masking format for `COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_NAME` to shuffle values within each `REGION_ID`.
8. Configure a masking format that masks columns with email addresses that contain `@ORACLE.COM` to end with `@EXAMPLE.COM`.
9. Configure a masking format for `JOB_HISTORY.DATE_OF_TERMINATION` that generates dates from two years ago to the present.
10. Configure a masking format for `EMPLOYEES.SALARY` that masks values greater than **10000** with the fixed number **10000**.
11. Configure a masking format for `SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.BONUS_AMOUNT` that generates a random list of values, including **1000**, **1500**, **2000**, **2500**, and **3000**.
12. Configure a masking format for `EMP_EXTENDED.PAYMENTACCOUNTNO` that generates random Visa credit card numbers.
13. Configure a masking format for `DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID` that uses the masking format you created (**<username> Custom Department IDs**). If you did not create this masking format, see [Masking Lab 3 - Create a Masking Format in Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Masking%20Lab%203.md). This masking format generates random numbers from **10** to **9990**.
14. Schedule the data masking job to run immediately and then view the masking report.
15. Sign in to your ATP-D database as the `ADMIN` user with SQL Developer Web.
16. In SQL Developer Web, verify that the data is masked according to your masking policy.

Connect to ATP-D DB using SQL Developer Web

Refer Step 5 from [Lab - Assess Users with Oracle Data Safe](https://github.com/labmaterial/adbguides-dev/blob/master/adb-datasafe/Assessment%20Lab%202.md)

## STEP 3: Verify masked data using SQL Developer

In SQL Developer Web, verify that the data is masked according to your masking policy

Because many of the masking formats use random formulas, your results are probably different than those shown below.

- Select all the contents of the `DEPARTMENTS` table:

```
<copy>SELECT * FROM HCM1.COUNTRIES;</copy>
```

- View the masked data for the `COUNTRY_NAME` column. Clear the worksheet when you're done.
  - Sample data before masking: Argentina `(REGION_ID = 2, COUNTRY_ID = AR)`.
  - Sample data after masking: Argentina `(REGION_ID = 2, COUNTRY_ID = MX)`.
  - **Note:** Follow the same steps with the next tables.

- Select all the contents of the `EMPLOYEES` table:

```
<copy>SELECT * FROM HCM1.EMPLOYEES;</copy>
```

- `EMAIL`: Sample data before masking: `JLIVINGS@ORACLE.COM`. Sample data after masking: `JLIVINGS@EXAMPLE.COM`
- `SALARY`: Sample data before masking: 11000. Sample data after masking: 10000. There should be no salary numbers greater than 10000 and no null values.

- Select all the contents of the `EMPLOYEES` table:

```
<copy>SELECT * FROM HCM1.JOB_HISTORY;</copy>
```

- View the masked data for the `DATE_OF_TERMINATION` column. Clear the worksheet when you're done.
  - Sample data before masking: `03-JAN-84`. Sample data after masking: `29-DEC-18`.

- Select all the contents of the `LOCATIONS` table:

```
<copy>SELECT * FROM HCM1.LOCATIONS;</copy>
```

- View the masked data for the `POSTAL_CODE` column. Clear the worksheet when you're done.
  - Sample data before masking: `YSW 9T2`. Sample data after masking: `61020`. Notice that if a postal code did not exist before, the result is (null).

- Select all the contents of the `SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA` table:

```
<copy>SELECT * FROM SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA;</copy>
```

- View the masked data for the following columns.
  - `TAXPAYER_ID`: Sample data before masking: `406-12-9866`. Sample data after masking: `***-**-****`
  - `BONUS_AMOUNT`: Sample data before masking: `40396`. Sample data after masking: `2500`
