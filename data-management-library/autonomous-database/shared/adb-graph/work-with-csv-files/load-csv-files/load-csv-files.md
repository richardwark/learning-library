# Graph Studio: Load data from CSV files into tables

## Introduction

In this lab you will load two CSV files into corresponding tables using the Database Actions SQL (aka SQLDeveloperWeb) interface of your 
Autonomous Data Warehouse - Shared Infrastructure (ADW) or Autonomous Transaction Processing - Shared Infrastructure (ATP) instance.

The following video shows the steps you will execute in this lab.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes. 

### Objectives

Learn how to
- load CSV files into an Autonomous Database using Database Actions.


### Prerequisites

- The following lab requires an Autonomous Database - Shared Infrastructure account. 
- It assumes that a Graph and Web-Access enabled user has been created. That is, a database user with the correct roles and privileges exists and that user can log into Database Actions.


## **STEP 1**: Connect to the Database Actions for your Autonomous Database instance

1. Open the service detail page for your Autonomous Database instance in the OCI console.  

   ![](images/../../query-graph/images/adb-details-page.png " ")  

2. Click on the Tools tab and then the Database Actions link to open it.

## **STEP 2**: Login as the graph-enabled user

1. Login as the graph user (e.g. `GRAPHUSER`) for your Autonomous Database instance. 
   
    ![](./images/db-actions-graphuser-login.png " ")  

    **Note:** If necessary, do the following to create the user with the right roles and privileges:
    - Log in to Database Actions as the ADMIN user for your Autonomous Database.
    - Select Administration and then Database Users from the navigation menu
    - Click on Create User
    - Turn on the Web-Access and Graph buttons

## **STEP 3**: Download the sample datasets from the ObjectStore

1. Copy and paste the url in your browser for the zip archive, i.e.  

    ```
    https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/EmjceN7dh4exJAwe8llQzAOMi4Y4pe9deZbpOXDpcjmoXYQ98Xu7XVFinPudEQwM/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/random-acct-txn-data.zip
    ```

   Or use `wget` or `curl` to download the sample data to you computer.   
   A sample `curl` request is:
    ```
    curl -G -o acct-txn-data.zip https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/EmjceN7dh4exJAwe8llQzAOMi4Y4pe9deZbpOXDpcjmoXYQ98Xu7XVFinPudEQwM/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/random-acct-txn-data.zip
    ```

2. **Unzip** the archive into a local directory such as ~/downloads.

## **STEP 4**: Upload using Database Actions Data Load

1. Click on the Data Load card. 
   
   ![](images/db-actions-dataload-card.png " ")
   
   Then specifcy the location of your data. That is, make sure the Load Data and the Local File cards are checked. Click `Next`.

   ![](./images/db-actions-dataload-location.png)

2. Click on `Select Files`.
   
      ![](images/db-action-dataload-file-browser.png " ") 

    Navigate to the correct folder (e.g. ~/downloads/random-acct-data) and select the bank_account.csv and the bank_txns.csv file.

    ![](./images/db-actions-dataload-choose-files.png " ")

3. Verify that the correct files were selected and then click `Run` icon.
![](./images/b-actions-dataload-click-run.png " ")

4. Confirm that you wish the data laod job.

   ![](./images/db-actions-dataload-confirm-run.png " ")

5. Once the files are loaded 
   
   ![](./images/db-actions-dataload-files-loaded.png " ")  

   Click `Done` to exit.

   ![](images/db-actions-dataload-click-done.png " ")

6. Now open the SQL Worksheet.
   ![](./images/db-actions-choose-sql-card.png " ")

7. Navigate to the correct folder (e.g. ~/downloads) and select the `fixup.sql` file and drag and drop it into the SQL worksheet. 
   
   ![](./images/db-actions-drag-drop-fixup-sql.png " ")  

   The contents of `fixup.sql` are:

   ```
   alter table bank_accounts add primary key (acct_id);
   
   alter table bank_txns add txn_id number;
   update bank_txns set txn_id = rownum;
   commit;
   
   alter table bank_txns add primary key (txn_id);
   alter table bank_txns modify from_acct_id references bank_accounts (acct_id);
   alter table bank_txns modify to_acct_id references bank_accounts (acct_id);

   desc bank_txns;
   
   select * from USER_CONS_COLUMNS where table_name in ('BANK_ACCOUNTS', 'BANK_TXNS');
   
   ```

   It does the following:
   - Adds a primary key constraint to the `bank_accounts` table.
   - Adds a column (`txn_id`) to the `bank_txns` table.
   - Sets a value for the `txn_id` and commits the transaction.
   - Adds a primary key constraint to the `bank_txns` table.
   - Adds a foreign key constraint to the `bank_txns` table specifying that `from_acct_id` references `bank_accounts.acct_id`.
   - Adds a second foreign key constraint to the `bank_txns` table specifying that `to_acct_id` references `bank_accounts_acct_id`.  
   - Helps you verify that the `txn_id` column was added and the cosntraints defined.


8. Execute the `fixup.sql` script in the SQL worksheet.  
   ![](./images/db-actions-sql-execute-fixup.png " ")  
   
9. The script output should look as as follows:
   
   ![](./images/db-actions-sql-script-output.png " ")
  

Please *proceed to the next lab* to create a graph from these tables.
