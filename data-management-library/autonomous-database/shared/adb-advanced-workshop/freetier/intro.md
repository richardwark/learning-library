# Introduction

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S)**. You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADB instance, scale an ADB instance, and use Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.

With Oracle Autonomous Database, we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud which allows you to start loading and analyzing your data immediately.

## **What is an Autonomous Database?**
Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing are built around the market-leading Oracle database and come with fully automated data warehouse and transaction processing specific features that deliver outstanding query performance. This environment is delivered as a fully managed cloud service running on optimized high-end Oracle hardware systems.  You don’t need to spend time thinking about how you should store your data, when or how to back it up, or how to tune your queries. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle’s Autonomous Database is the perfect quick-start service for fast data loading and sophisticated data reporting and analysis. Oracle manages everything for you, so you can focus on your data.

Estimated workshop time: 3 hours and 45 minutes

## **Workshop Objectives**
- Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
- Provision a new Autonomous Database instance on Shared Infrastructure
- Run sample queries against the sample data sets
- Load data from the object store
- Query external data from the object store
- Scale an ADB instance
- Create Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks
- Use the in-database DBMS\_PREDICTIVE\_ANALYTICS functionality

## **Lab Breakdown**
- **Lab 1:** Provision your first Autonomous Data Warehouse.
- **Lab 2:** Explore SQL Developer Web with provided sample data sets.
- **Lab 3:** Upload files to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage, create sample tables, load data into them from files on the OCI Object Storage, and troubleshoot data loads with errors.
- **Lab 4:** Query files on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage (OCI) directly without loading them to your database.
- **Lab 5:** Visualize your data using Oracle Analytics Desktop.
- **Lab 6:** Use wallets for secure connections to the autonomous database.
- **Lab 7:** Monitor your autonomous Database.
- **Lab 8:** Scale up your Oracle Autonomous Database service to have more CPUs.
- **Lab 9:** Create Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks.
- **Lab 10:** Use the in-database DBMS\_PREDICTIVE\_ANALYTICS machine learning algorithm.
