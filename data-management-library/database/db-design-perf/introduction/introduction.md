# Introduction                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through a series of activities to tap into the full performance potential of the **Oracle Autonomous Database** though good Database Design. You will provision a new autonomous database instance in the Oracle Cloud, connect to the database using Database Actions and Cloud Shell, conduct an initial performance benchmark, then optimize the design for both single session throughput and then concurrent throughput.

With Oracle Autonomous Database we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud and start building applications and then optimizing the database design immediately.

### **What is an Autonomous Database?**
An autonomous database is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate database security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by DBAs. Unlike a conventional database, an autonomous database performs all these tasks and more without human intervention. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle's Autonomous Database is the perfect quick-start service for building modern applications for the cloud. Oracle manages everything for you so you can focus on your building great applications for your customers.

Estimated Workshop Time: 70 minutes

### Workshop Prerequisites
This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, a Free Tier account, a LiveLabs account or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***

### Workshop Objectives
- Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
- Provision a new Autonomous Database instance on Shared Infrastructure
