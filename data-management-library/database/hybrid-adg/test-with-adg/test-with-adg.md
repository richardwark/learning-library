# Testing with Active Data Guard

## Introduction
Now we can run some testing with the ADG including DML redirection and switchover.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

-   Test transaction replication 
-    Check lag between the primary and standby
-   Test DML Redirection
-   Switchover to the Cloud

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Deploy Active Data Guard with LVM or ASM

## **STEP 1:** Test Transaction Replication

1. From on-premise side, create a test user in orclpdb, and grant privileges to the user. You need  to check if the pdb is open.

    ```
    [oracle@primary ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    SQL> grant connect,resource to testuser;

    Grant succeeded.

    SQL> alter user testuser quota unlimited on users;

    User altered.

    SQL> exit;
    ```

2. Connect with testuser, create test table and insert a test record.

    ```
    [oracle@primary ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@primary:1521/orclpdb

    SQL> insert into test values(1,'line1');

    1 row created.

    SQL> commit;

    Commit complete.

    SQL>  
    ```

3. From cloud side, open the standby database as read only.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    ```
    If the `OPEN_MODE` is **READ ONLY**, you can run the following command in sqlplus as sysdba, then check the `open_mode` again, you can see the `OPEN_MODE` is **READ ONLY WITH APPLY** now.
    ```
    SQL> alter database recover managed standby database cancel;

    Database altered.

    SQL> alter database recover managed standby database using current logfile disconnect;

    SQL> select open_mode,database_role from v$database;

    OPEN_MODE	     DATABASE_ROLE
    -------------------- ----------------
    READ ONLY WITH APPLY PHYSICAL STANDBY
    ```

4. From cloud side, connect as testuser to orclpdb. Check if the test table and record has replicated to the standby.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@dbstby:1521/orclpdb

    ```

## **STEP 2:** Check Lag between the Primary and Standby

There are several ways to check the lag between the primary and standby.

1. First let's prepare a sample workload in the primary side. Copy the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Bq05Vhib-p_vraOu-wFpTEmyydA4d8qekXWXcb6W6M3pL43LVSAS2eFwKpYvAVxQ/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/workload.sh
    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/KNpGKB2VdoBWC5VWOHvD5vHg9P1OO5mqBJUxNonwY9LzaMaZ8Kcu7w3wBq9xgebW/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/scn.sql
    </copy>
    ```

   

2. From on-premise side, run as **oracle** user, download scripts using the command you copied.

    ```
    [oracle@primary ~]$ wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Bq05Vhib-p_vraOu-wFpTEmyydA4d8qekXWXcb6W6M3pL43LVSAS2eFwKpYvAVxQ/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/workload.sh

    ```
    
   
   
3. Change mode of the `workload.sh` file and run the workload. Ignore the error message of drop table. Keep this window open and running for the next few steps in this lab.

    ```
    [oracle@primary ~]$ chmod a+x workload.sh 
    [oracle@primary ~]$ . ./workload.sh 
    
      NOTE:

    ```

   

4. From the standby side, connect as **testuser** to orclpdb,  count the records in the sample table several times. using the standby database hostname or public ip address. Compare the record number with the primary side.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@dbstby:1521/orclpdb

      COUNT(*)
    ----------
      390
    
    SQL> 
    ```

      

5. From standby site, connect as sysdba. Check the Oracle System Change Number (SCN). Compare it with the primary side.

    ```
    SQL> connect / as sysdba
    Connected.
    SQL> SELECT current_scn FROM v$database;
    
    CURRENT_SCN
    -----------
        2784330
    ```
   
   
   
6. From standby site, query the `v$dataguard_stats` view to check the lag.

    ```
    SQL> set linesize 120;
    SQL> column name format a25;
    SQL> column value format a20;
    SQL> column time_computed format a20;

    SQL> select name, value, time_computed, datum_time from v$dataguard_stats;

    SQL> 
    ```

   

7. Check lag using Data Guard Broker. Replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby database unique name.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl

    ```

   

8. From the on-premise side, press `Ctrl-C` to terminate the running workload.

 

## **STEP 3:** Test DML Redirection

Starting  with Oracle DB 19c, we can run DML operations on Active Data Guard standby databases. This enables you to occasionally execute DMLs on read-mostly applications on the standby database.

Automatic redirection of DML operations to the primary can be configured at the system level or the session level. The session level setting overrides the system level

1. From the standby side, connect to orclpdb as **testuser**. Test the DML before and after the DML Redirection is enabled.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus testuser/testuser@dbstby:1521/orclpdb

    ```

    You may encounter the performance issue when using the DML redirection. This is because each of the DML is issued on a standby database will be passed to the primary database where it is executed. The default Data Guard protection mode is Maximum Performance and the redo transport mode is ASYNC. The session waits until the corresponding changes are shipped to and applied to the standby. In order to improve performance of the DML redirection, you need to switch the redo logfile more frequently on the primary side, or you can change the protection mode to Maximum Availability and the redo transport mode to SYNC - This protection mode provides the highest level of data protection, but it's need the high throughput and low latency network, you can use FastConnect or deploy the Data Guard in different ADs within the same region.

2. From the primary side, connect with Data Guard Broker, check the current protection mode and redo transport mode. Replace the `orcl_nrt1d4` to your standby db unique name.

    ```
    [oracle@primary ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl

    ```

   

3. Switch the redo transport mode and protection mode. Replace the `orcl_nrt1d4` to your standby db unique name.

    ```
    DGMGRL> EDIT DATABASE orcl SET PROPERTY LogXptMode='SYNC';
    Property "logxptmode" updated

    ```

    

4. From the standby side, test the DML redirection again. You can see the performance improved.

    ```

    ```

   

5. From the primary side, in the Data Guard Broker, switch back the protection mode. Replace the `orcl_nrt1d4` to your standby db unique name.

    ```
    DGMGRL> EDIT CONFIGURATION SET PROTECTION MODE AS MAXPERFORMANCE;
    Succeeded.

    Configuration Status:

    ```

   



## **STEP 4:** Switchover to the Cloud 

At any time, you can manually execute a Data Guard switchover (planned event) or failover (unplanned event). Customers may also choose to automate Data Guard failover by configuring Fast-Start failover. Switchover and failover reverse the roles of the databases in a Data Guard configuration – the standby in the cloud becomes primary and the original on-premise primary becomes a standby database. Refer to Oracle MAA Best Practices for additional information on Data Guard role transitions. 

Switchovers are always a planned event that guarantees no data is lost. To execute a switchover, perform the following in Data Guard Broker 

1. Connect DGMGRL from on-premise side, validate the standby database to see if Ready For Switchover is Yes. Replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

    ```
