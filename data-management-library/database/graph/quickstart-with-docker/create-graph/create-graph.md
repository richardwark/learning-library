# Create the Graph

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to create a graph from the database tables containing customer, account, purchase, and relationship data.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In the lab, you will:
* Create a graph from the database tables

### Prerequisites

* This lab assumes that you have successfully completed the labs - Setup a Property Graph Analysis Environment in Docker, Setup Oracle Database in Docker, Create and Populate Database Tables

## **STEP 1:** Create the Customer 360 Property Graph

1. If you don't have an open SSH connection to your compute instance, open a terminal window. Navigate to the folder where you created the SSH keys, replace *your-key-name* with your private key name and *your-instance-ip-address* with your compute instance ip address and connect to your compute instance:

    ```
    ssh -i ./your-key-name opc@your-instance-ip-address
    ```

2. The following DDL creates a property graph (i.e. node and edge tables) from the relational table data.

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH customer_360
      VERTEX TABLES (
        customer
          LABEL "Customer"
          PROPERTIES (
            type AS "type"
          , name AS "name"
          , age AS "age"
          , location AS "location"
          , gender AS "gender"
          , student AS "student"
          )
      , account
          LABEL "Account"
          PROPERTIES (
            type AS "type"
          , account_no AS "account_no"
          , balance AS "balance"
          )
      , merchant
          LABEL "Merchant"
          PROPERTIES (
            type AS "type"
          , name AS "name"
          )
      )
      EDGE TABLES (
        owned_by
          SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
          DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES customer
          LABEL "owned_by"
          PROPERTIES (
            since AS "since"
          )
      , parent_of
          SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES customer
          DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES customer
          LABEL "parent_of"
      , purchased
          SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
          DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES merchant
          LABEL "purchased"
          PROPERTIES (
            amount AS "amount"
          )
      , transfer
          SOURCE KEY(from_id) REFERENCES account
          DESTINATION KEY(to_id) REFERENCES account
          LABEL "transfer"
          PROPERTIES (
            amount AS "amount"
          , date AS "date"
          )
      )
    </copy>
    ```

  Note: The file is part of the repository under the `graphs/customer_360/` directory. The parent directory is mapped to `/graphs` in the container.

3. Using Graph Client, connect to Oracle Database and run the DDL above.

  If the graph-client is not up and running start it by executing the following command.

    ```
    <copy>docker-compose -f docker-compose-rdbms.yml up -d graph-client</copy>
    ```

4. Then start a JShell in the client.

    ```
    $ <copy>docker exec -it graph-client opg-rdbms-jshell</copy>
    ```

  Once JShell is running and you see the lines.

    ```
    Oracle Graph Server Shell 20.1.0
    PGX server version: 19.4.0 type: SM
    PGX server API version: 3.6.0
    PGQL version: 1.2
    Variables instance, session, and analyst ready to use.
    opg-rdbms-jshell>
    ```

5. Enter the following code to:

    - Specify the JDBC connection to the database
    - Open a Connection
    - Set a required parameter for PGQL operation
    - Create a PgqlConnection
    - Read, prepare, and execute the CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement

    ```
    <copy>
    var jdbcUrl = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db:1521/orclpdb1";
    var conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, "customer_360", "Welcome1");
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);
    var pgql = PgqlConnection.getConnection(conn);
    pgql.prepareStatement(Files.readString(Paths.get("/graphs/customer_360/create_pg.pgql"))).execute();
    </copy>
    ```

  Note: The execute() above will return `false` on completion since the first result is not a ResultSet.

## **STEP 2:** Check if the graph was created

1. You can check the graph by executing the following code and query (= PGQL on RDBMS) in the JShell.

  How many nodes are in the newly created property graph?

  Enter the following code in JShell.

    ```
    <copy>
    Consumer&lt;String&gt; query = q -> {
        try(var s = pgql.prepareStatement(q)) {
          s.execute();
          s.getResultSet().print();
        } catch(Exception e) {
          throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
      };

    query.accept("select count(v) from customer_360 match (v)");
    </copy>
    +----------+
    | count(v) |
    +----------+
    | 15       |
    +----------+
    ```

2. Exit the JShell.

    ```
    <copy>
    /exit
    </copy>
    ```

You may now proceed to the next lab where you will load, query, and analyze the Customer 360 graph.
