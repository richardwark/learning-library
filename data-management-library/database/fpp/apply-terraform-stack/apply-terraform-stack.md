# Create the Environment with Resource Manager
## Introduction
This lab will show you how to setup a Resource Manager stack that will generate the Oracle Cloud objects needed to run this workshop. This workshop requires a DB System running the FPP Server and a Compute Instance to run the FPP Target in a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).

Estimated Lab time: 20 minutes (Execution Time - 2 hours)

### About Terraform and Oracle Cloud Resource Manager
For more information about Terraform and Resource Manager, please see the appendix below.

### Objectives
* Create the DB System, Compute and Networking Resource Manager stack.
* Get the public IP address of the FPP server.

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Livelabs or Paid Oracle Cloud Account.
* A SSH key-pair ready to use.

## **Step 1:** Create the stack

1. Click on the link below to download the Resource Manager zip file you need to build your environment.

    [tf-fpp-1.0.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/o387wRpvG_oMB4lmVNV8e9M5tw3r5mGsS6oCBDxfM8ag34a7bjTnrwVQDlwb-ot6/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/tf-fpp-1.0.zip)

2. Login to Oracle Cloud
3. Select the correct region
4. Open up the hamburger menu in the left hand corner. Select **Developer Services**. Under **Resource Manager** select **Stacks**.

5. In the left pane, select the compartment where you would like to create the environment. It is recommended that you choose an empty compartment.

6. Click on Create Stack

7. Select **My Configuration**, choose the **.ZIP FILE** button, click the **Browse** link and select the zip file (tf-fpp-1.0.zip) that you downloaded. Click **Select**.

8. Make sure that the base information is populated properly

9. Click **Next**
10. In the **Configure Variables** step, select the appropriate Availability Domain (depending on your region you may need to specify it or not)
11. Paste your **SSH Public Key**, you will need the corresponding private key to access the FPP Server once the environment will be provisioned
12. The variable **ResID** is Optional. You can use it to add a specific suffix to the Display Name of the Cloud Resources.

13. Click **Next**
14. Review the **Stack Information** and click **Create**

    Your Stack has now been created!

## **Step 2:** Terraform Plan (OPTIONAL)
This is optional, you may skip directly to Step 3.

When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a **Terraform plan** to verify the configuration.
1. **[OPTIONAL]** Click **Plan** to validate your configuration. 
    ![](./images/plan-job.png)

2. Select the **Plan** button in the bottom right of the screen. This takes about a minute, please be patient.

## **Step 3:** Terraform Apply
When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a **Terraform Apply** to actually create the configuration. Let's do that now.

1. At the top of your page, click on **Stack Details**. click the **Apply** button. 

    ![](./images/apply-job.png)

2. Select the **Apply** button in the bottom right of the screen. This will create your cloud network, the db system and the compute instance.
    ![](./images/apply-job2.png)

3. Once this job succeeds, you will get an apply complete notification from Terraform. Examine it closely.

4. In the left pane, click **Outputs**
5. Click on **Show** next to **fppserver** to show the IP address of the FPP Server. Note it down, you will need it to access it as **opc** user with the private key that you have supplied when creating the stack.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next) and connect to the server.
