# Consolidate Workloads to Autonomous Database using MV2ADB
## Introduction
Move to Autonomous Database (MV2ADB) is a tool, which migrates data from an "on premises" database to Autonomous Database Cloud utilizing Oracle Data Pump. Data Pump lets you Import your data into Autonomous Database using Data Pump Dump Files which are residing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage.
The MV2ADB tool is able to automatically take a data pump export, push it to OCI Object Storage, then it automatically imports it into the Autonomous Database using Data Pump in one command.
*Note: For using mv2adb for migration from source DB to ADB, the source DB should be at lower version than Autonomous Database.*

- View the connect string via the tnsnames.ora from the ADB wallet on both Source database instances.
```
cd /root/instantclient_19_8/network/admin
cat tnsnames.ora
```
![](./screenshots/tnsnames_cat.png)
  *Note: Both 11g and 19c Source databases are being consolidated into one ADB database, so the connect string will be the same for both Source database instances.*



- Export instant client paths on both Source database instances.
```
export ORACLE_HOME=/root/instantclient_19_8
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ORACLE_HOME"
export PATH="$ORACLE_HOME:$PATH"
```

## STEP 9: Run the MV2ADB migration script on both Source database instances
The migration script will export from your source databases, then import into your Autonomous database using data pump. For more information, refer to the official steps from my Oracle support (MOS) [here](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?_afrLoop=291097898074822&id=2463574.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=v0102jx12_4).

- As root user on both source database instances, run the script in AUTO mode.
```
cd /opt/mv2adb
./mv2adb.bin auto -conf /opt/mv2adb/conf/DBNAME.mv2adb.cfg
```
![](./screenshots/mv2adb_run.png)
![](./screenshots/autorun_1.png)


## STEP 10: Validate the Data Migration
- On both source database instances, run the mv2adb report.
```
cd /opt/mv2adb
./mv2adb.bin report -conf conf/DBNAME.mv2adb.cfg
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
**Dump File errors**
- Make sure to clear out the dump file directory after each failed iteration.
```
rm /home/oracle/dpump/*
```
![](./screenshots/cleardpumpdir.png)

  *Note: Validate the rm command is being ran on the DUMP_PATH parameter.*

**Account Locked error**
- Switch to Oracle user, set environment (.oraenv), sqlplus, and unlock.
- The following commands will display all users that are locked, and how to unlock a user.
```
sqlplus / as sysdba
SELECT username, account_status, created, lock_date, expiry_date FROM dba_users WHERE account_status != 'OPEN';
ALTER USER username ACCOUNT UNLOCK
```

**Cannot Open Logfile**
- Change directory group from root:root to oracle:oninstall, and change permissions.
```
chown oracle:oinstall /home/oracle/dpump
chmod -R 660 /home/oracle/dpump
```

**Getting an unreasonable amount of errors**
- Verify the config file has the FULL=Y parameter commented out.
