# Set up the environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create the required resources you'll use for OCI GoldenGate. We'll show you how to create a VCN and subnet, provision autonomous database instances, and load data into the databases.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 mins

### Objectives
-  Learn to provision a VCN and subnet
-  Learn how to provision, connect, and load data into an Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) instance
-  Learn how to provision, connect, and load data into an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Sign Up for Free Tier/Login to Oracle Cloud

*Note: You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.*

In this section, you will provision a VCN and subnet, ATP and ADW instances, and load data to use with OCI GoldenGate.

## **STEP 1:** Create a VCN and subnet


1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Networking**, and select **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

2.  Click **Start VCN Wizard**.

3.  Select **VCN with Internet Connectivity**, and then click **Start VCN Wizard.**

    ![Select VCN with Internet Connectivity](./images/00-03-vcn-wizard.png)

4.  Enter a name for the VCN, select a compartment, and then click **Next**.

You can click View VCN Details and see both a Public and Private subnet were created.

## **STEP 2:** Create an ATP Instance

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

## **STEP 3:** Load the ATP schema

1.  Click the following link to download the database schema.

    [Archive.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/GBBFZbbFdladZV7maRiV3egDpZ_jCOglhpEWyqOgEuKZzIjxqeDgbrq9_WRhzjR5/n/c4u04/b/data-management-library-files/o/Archive.zip)

2.  Save `Archive.zip` to a download directory, and then unzip the file.

3.  Back in the OCI Console, select your ATP instance from the Autonomous Databases list to view its details and access tools.

    ![Select ATP database](./images/02-03-atp.png)

4.  Click the **Tools** tab, and then click **Open Database Actions**.

    ![Click Tools](./images/02-04-tools.png)

    ![Click Open Database Actions](./images/02-04-db-actions.png)

5.  Log in with the ADMIN user and password provided when you created the ATP instance.

    ![Log in to Database Actions](./images/02-05-login.png)

6.  From the Database Actions menu, under **Development**, select **SQL**.

    ![Select SQL](./images/02-06-db-actions.png)

7.  (Optional) Click **X** to close the Help dialog.

8.  Copy the SQL script from **OCIGGLL\_OCIGGS\_SETUP\_USERS\_ATP.sql** paste it into the SQL Worksheet.

    ![Paste ATP User Set Up](./images/02-08-atp-sql.png)

9.  Click **Run Script**. The Script Output tab displays confirmation messages.

10. Copy the SQL script from **OCIGGLL\_OCIGGS\_SRC\_USER\_SEED\_DATA.sql** and paste it into a new SQL Worksheet.

    ![Paste ATP User Seed](./images/02-10-atp-schema.png)

11. Click **Run Script**. The Script Output tab displays confirmation messages.

12. In the Navigator tab, look for the SRC\_OCIGGLL schema and then select tables from their respective dropdowns to verify the schema and tables were created. You may need to log out and log back in if you can't locate SRC\_OCIGGLL.
