    * Introduction and Prerequisites

**STEP 1:** Open the Oracle GoldenGate Services Ports from the OCI Console

Before you begin to discover the Oracle GoldenGate instances, you need to open all the Oracle GoldenGate Services port from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) console, and the Proxy ports on Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Marketplace instance. If the Service Manager, Administration Server, Distribution Server, Receiver Server, Performance Metrics server ports are not opened, then the Oracle Enterprise Manager Plug-in cannot discover the instances.

You may choose to white-list the ports to Oracle Enterprise Manager Marketplace instance. By doing this, no other instances will be able access the GoldenGate Marketplace instance ports, hence making  secured.

To open the ports:
1. Login to your Cloud account and access the Oracle GoldenGate Microservices instance. Start an instance of Oracle GoldenGate (Microservices) Marketplace.

2. Create the default ingress rule (in the Network’s VCN) to open the Microservices Port (Administrator Server, Distribution Server, Receiver server, and Performance server) for Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in to access these services. You can open these ports through the OCI Cloud account’s Network section. For example, open all the ports from 9000 through 9010 where your Oracle GoldenGate Microservices services are running.

For more information, see [Security Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm#stateful).

3. Log-in to your Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace instance using the private key that you have given while provisioning the instance. See [Deploying Oracle GoldenGate Microservices on Oracle Cloud Marketplace](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/oggmp/oracle-goldengate-microservices-oracle.html#GUID-EF6680D7-7571-41E7-BF2D-831BD79BCC15) to login to Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace.
4. In the Oracle GoldenGate Microservices instance, run the following command to expose the Service Manager, Administration Server, Receiver Server, Distribution Server, and Performance Metrics Server ports:
    <pre>sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=*<OGG Process port number>*/tcp</pre>

**STEP 2**: Install Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in

1. Download Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in from [Oracle GoldenGate Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/in/middleware/technologies/goldengate-downloads.html).
2. Copy the Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in to Oracle Marketplace on which, Enterprise Manager is installed.
3. See [Deploying Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/emplugin/13.4.2/install/deploying-plug.html#GUID-D024EC6B-75A8-4333-BCEF-04B154614C6F) to install Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in.

**STEP 3:** Discover Oracle GoldenGate Microservices instances in Oracle Enterprise Manager on Marketplace

**STEP 4:** Set Monitoring Credentials to Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Marketplace in Enterprise Manager Plug-in

If you are an Enterprise Manager administrator, then you also have the option of storing credentials in a secure manner — as preferences or operation credentials. You can then use these credentials to perform different system management activities like real-time monitoring, patching, provisioning, and other target administrative operations.

You need to set the credentials (Monitoring and Preferred Credentials) for an MA instance.

To set the Monitoring credentials:
  1. Click **Setup**, select **Security**, and click **Monitoring Credentials** to display the **Monitoring Credentials** page.
      ![](./images/13a.png " ")

  2. Select **Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager** and click **Manage Monitoring Credentials**.

      The credentials are set successfully and this Information is indicated on the screen.
  5. Click **Targets** and select **GoldenGate**.
      ![](./images/16.png " ")

  6. Notice the status has changed for the targets.
      ![](./images/18.png " ")

  7. Select a target and notice that the **Start** and **Stop** buttons are activated for the target.
      ![](./images/19.png " ")

      The monitoring credentials are successfully set and you can monitor the instance, view the logs, configuration files, and GGSERR files, and also start or stop the instance.                                         

  **STEP 5:** Set Preferred Credentials to Oracle GoldenGate MA Marketplace instances in Enterprise Manager Plug-in

  It is required to set preferred credentials to Oracle GoldenGate Service manager target for Oracle GoldenGate Microservices instances in addition to monitoring credentials. While setting preferred credentials for a Microservices instance, you need to add only the host credential.

  **Note**: This is a mandatory step starting from Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in 13.4.2.0.0 onwards and is an optional step for earlier releases.

    To set Preferred Credentials:

    1. Click **Setup**, select **Security**, and click **Preferred Credentials** to display the **Preferred Credentials** page.
