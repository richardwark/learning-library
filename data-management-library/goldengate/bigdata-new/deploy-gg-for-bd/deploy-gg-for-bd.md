### Objectives
- Deploy GoldenGate for Big Data

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## **STEP 0:** Running your Lab
### Login to Host using SSH Key based authentication
Refer to *Lab Environment Setup* for detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*
  - OS User – “*ggadmin*”.

1. First login as “*opc*” using your SSH Private Key

2. Then sudo to “*ggadmin*”. E.g.

    ```
    <copy>sudo su - ggadmin</copy>
    ```
Follow the steps below to install GoldenGate, or optionally you can select “I” from the Lab Menu below to auto-install GG.

3. Review the labmenu, then Select **Q** to quit to install GoldenGate Big Data Adapter Handlers

  The following Lab Menu will be displayed

  These online notes have been provided so you can cut/paste file names to another session, to avoid typos.

2. To install and configure GoldenGate, we have extracted the GG binaries from a tar file prior to the labs – this file has been copied to /u01 as part of the setup. We will connect to the GoldenGate command line interface (ggsci) and run CREATE SUBDIRS to create the subdirectories in the GoldenGate home.

    ```
    <copy>cd /u01/gg4hadoop123010
    tar -xvf  /u01/gg_binaries/gg4hadoop123010/ggs_Adapters_Linux_x64.tar </copy>
    ```
    **type**

    ```
    <copy>./ggsci</copy>

    <copy>info all</copy>

    <copy>exit</copy>
    ```
    **type**
    ```
    <copy>labmenu</copy>
    ```

**Optional**  (Do not select Auto-install if you already installed GG manually)

If you would like to auto-install GoldenGate for Big Data, you can select option **I**. To access the Lab Menu, type the alias `labmenu`, then select **I**.

***Congratulations!***, GoldenGate for Big Data is now installed. You can proceed to the next lab, or to any other lab. Each lab can be run independently.
