# Introduction to GoldenGate Stream Analytics

This workshop includes quick hands-on labs to transform and analyze real-time data streams, using Oracle GoldenGate Stream Analytics.  

## What is GoldenGate Stream Analytics

Golden Gate Stream Analytics is an environment that originally began as a Complex Event Processing engine and evolved to run on top of runtime frameworks with Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.  The tool is designed to ingest a stream of data from any source such as a database, GoldenGate, Kafka, JMS, REST, or even a file system file. After the data is in GGSA you can run analytics on live data, using the transformation and action functionality of Spark, and send the data downstream to any target of your choice.  

## Workshop Objectives

* Lab 1: Create a basic pipeline using a file stream, in under 10 minutes.
