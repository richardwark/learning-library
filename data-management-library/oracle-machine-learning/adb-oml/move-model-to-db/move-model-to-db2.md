# Deploy the Machine Learning Model into ATP

## Introduction

In the previous lab, you created a machine learning model that can predict customer credit. Congratulations! But you’re not finished. It’s a good model, but models have to be deployed into production systems, they have to positively impact the business, and too many machine learning projects fail at this point. We are going to spend the next two labs making sure you deploy this model so that Alpha Office employees can use it in their day to day work.

The first step is to move the model from where it was developed into a production transaction processing database where it will be accessible to the Client Service application. This lab will take you through that process.

Estimated lab time: 20 - 30 minutes

Watch this short video to preview how to deploy the machine learning model into ATP.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- In ADW:
    - Log in with ML\_USER and export the model to a temporary table.
    - Download the credential wallet and upload it to object storage

- In ATP:
    - Create a new ML\_USER and grant that user access to the SQL Developer Web, and to storage.
    - Create a database link that will be used to copy (pull) export of the ml model from ADW to ATP.
    - Copy the model from ADW to ATP.
    - Log in with ML\_USER and import the ml model.
    - Create a virtual column on the table that applies the model to rows in the table.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Login to Oracle Cloud/Sign Up for Free Tier Account
- Connect and Provision ADB
- Create a Machine Learning Model

## **STEP 1:** Export the machine learning model

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** and navigate to your instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

    ![](./images/adw-instance.png " ")

2.  On the **Tools** tab of your ADW instance, click on **Open Database Actions**.

    ![](./images/tools.png " ")

    ![](./images/open-database-actions.png  " ")

3.  Provide the **Username - ML\_USER** and click **Next**. Then provide the password for your ML\_USER and click **Sign in**.

    ![](images/ml-user-next.png)

    ![](images/ml-user-sign-in.png)

4. From the Database Actions menu, choose **SQL**.

    ![](./images/sql.png " ")

    ![](./images/ml-user-sql-developer.png " ")

5.  Create a temporary table to hold the data mining model.

    ````
    <copy>
    create table temp(my_model blob);
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/temp.png  " ")

6.  Confirm the machine learning model that was built. This has been done in lab 1 and lab 2 by executing the steps in the Credit Scoring notebook and Targeting Customers That Complete All Payments Notebook respectively.

    ````
    <copy>
    select * from user_mining_models;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/ml-model-created.png  " ")

7.  Export the ML model to this temporary table. The model will be stored in a binary large object.

    ````
    <copy>
    DECLARE
    v_blob blob;
    BEGIN
    dbms_lob.createtemporary(v_blob, FALSE);
    dbms_data_mining.export_sermodel(v_blob, 'N1_CLASS_MODEL');
    insert into temp values(v_blob);
    commit;
    dbms_lob.freetemporary(v_blob);
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/export-ml-model.png  " ")

8.  Confirm the model was exported by looking at the length of the blob (you can't see the binary data). Note your length may differ slightly.

    ````
    <copy>
    select length(my_model) from temp;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/blob-length.png  " ")

## **STEP 2:** Create ML User in ATP

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**, choose your compartment and navigate to your ATP instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-atp.png " ")

    ![](./images/atp-instance.png " ")

2.  Select **Tools** on the Autonomous Database Details page.

    ![](./images/atp-tools.png " ")

3.  Select **Open Oracle ML User Administration** under the tools.

    ![](./images/atp-open-ml-admin.png " ")

4. Sign in as **Username - ADMIN** with the password you used when you created your Autonomous instance.

    ![](./images/atp-ml-admin-login.png  " ")

6.  Click **Create** to create a new ML user.

    ![](./images/atp-create.png  " ")

7. On the Create User form, enter **Username - ML\_USER**, an e-mail address (you can use admin@oracle.com), un-check **Generate password**, and enter a password you will remember. You can use the same password you used for the ADMIN account. Then click **Create**.

    ![](./images/atp-ml-user.png  " ")

8. Notice that the **ML\_USER** is created.

    ![](./images/atp-ml-user-created.png " ")

## **STEP 3:** Grant Privileges to ML_USER to access Database Actions

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**, choose your compartment and navigate to your ATP instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-atp.png " ")

    ![](./images/atp-instance.png " ")

2.  Select **Tools** on the Autonomous Database Details page.

    ![](./images/atp-tools.png " ")

3. Select **Open Database Actions** under the tools.

    ![](./images/atp-open-database-actions.png  " ")

4. On the Database Actions login page, log in with your ATP credentials, provide the **Username - ADMIN** and click **Next**. Then provide the <if type="freetier">**Password** you created for the Autonomous instance.</if><if type="livelabs">password **WELcome__1234**</if> and click **Sign in**.

    ![](./images/ml-admin.png " ")

    ![](./images/ml-admin-password.png " ")

5. From the Database Action menu, select **SQL**.

    ![](./images/sql.png " ")

6. Dismiss the Help by clicking on the **X** in the popup.

    ![](./images/click-x.png  " ")

7.  By default, only the ADMIN user can use the SQL Developer Web. To enable ML\_USER to use it, you need to enter the following and execute the procedure to grant SQL developer web access to ML\_USER.

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        p_enabled => TRUE,
        p_schema => 'ML_USER',
        p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
        p_url_mapping_pattern => 'ml_user',
        p_auto_rest_auth => TRUE
      );
      COMMIT;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/grant-mluser-access.png " ")

    ![](./images/mluser-access-granted.png " ")

8.  Grant storage privileges to ML\_USER.

    ````
    <copy>
    alter user ml_user quota 100m on data;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/storage-privileges.png " ")

## **STEP 4:** Download ADW Credentials Wallet

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** and navigate to your instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

    ![](./images/adw-instance.png " ")

2.  In the instance details page find your database and click **Service Console**.

    ![](./images/service-console.png  " ")

3.  Click on **Administration** and select **Download Client Credentials (Wallet)**.

    ![](./images/administration.png  " ")

    ![](./images/download-wallet.png  " ")

4.  Specify a password of your choice for the wallet. You will need this password when connecting to the database later. Click **Download** to download the wallet file to your client machine.

    ![](./images/wallet-password.png  " ")

5.  Unzip the downloaded wallet file, note the cwallet.sso file, you will need it later in this lab.

    ![](./images/unzip-wallet.png  " ")

## **STEP 5:** Create a Bucket and Upload Your Data

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Storage**, and select **Buckets**.

	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/storage-buckets.png " ")

2.  Choose the compartment and click **Create Bucket**.

    ![](./images/create-bucket.png " ")

3. Name the bucket - **adwc** in your compartment (not ManagedCompartmentForPaas) and click **Create**.

    ![](./images/create-adwc-bucket.png  " ")

4.  Select the **adwc** bucket.

    ![](./images/choose-adwc-bucket.png  " ")

5. Click on **Upload**, drag and drop or click on **select files** to upload the **cwallet.sso** file from the wallet zip file we downloaded from the ADW Instance earlier and click **Upload**.

    ![](./images/upload-object.png  " ")

    ![](./images/upload-wallet.png  " ")

6. On the menu of the **cwallet.sso** object, click on **View Object Details** and copy the URL Path to a notepad, we will need it later in this lab.

    ![](./images/view-object-details.png  " ")

    ![](./images/copy-uri-path.png  " ")

## **STEP 6:** Generate the Auth Token

To load data from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Object Storage you will need an OCI user with the appropriate privileges to read data (or upload) data to the Object Store. The communication between the database and the object store relies on the Swift protocol and the OCI user Auth Token.

1.   Go to Profile menu, click **User Settings** to view user details.

    ![](./images/user-settings.png  " ")

2.  Remember the username as you will need it in the next step.

    ![](./images/user-name.png  " ")

3.  On the left side of the page, under Resources, click **Auth Tokens**, and then **Generate Token**. Call it **adwc_token**. *Note: Be sure to copy it to notepad as you won't be able to see it again.*

    ![](./images/generate-auth-token.png  " ")

4. Call it **adwc_token** and click on **Generate Token**. *Note: Be sure to **copy** it to notepad as you won't be able to see it again.*

    ![](./images/adwc-token.png  " ")

    ![](./images/copy-token.png  " ")

## **STEP 7:** Copy Machine Learning Models between ADW and ATP

1.  Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**, choose your compartment and navigate to your ATP instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-atp.png " ")

    ![](./images/atp-instance.png " ")

2.  Select **Tools** on the Autonomous Database Details page and click on **Open Database Actions** under the tools.

    ![](./images/atp-tools.png " ")

    ![](./images/atp-open-database-actions.png  " ")

3.  Provide the **Username - ADMIN** and click **Next**. Then provide the password for your ADMIN user and click **Sign in**.

    ![](images/ml-admin.png)

    ![](images/ml-admin-password.png)

4. From the Database Actions menu, choose **SQL**.

    ![](./images/atp-sql.png " ")

    ![](./images/atp-admin-sql-developer.png " ")

5. With the ADMIN userid in ATP SQL Developer Web, create a credential to copy your ADW wallet from Object Storage to the DATA\_PUMP\_DIR which will be used later in this step. Specify the credentials:

    - Username: The username will be the OCI Username you noted earlier (which is not the same as your database username).
    - Password: The password will be the OCI Object Store Auth Token you just generated.

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
        credential_name => 'adwc_token',
        username => '&lt your cloud username &gt',
        password => '&lt generated auth token &gt'
      );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/adwc-credential.png  " ")

6.  Create another credential for the ADW database. For the **Username - ADMIN**, create a **Password**. This is your database ADMIN userid and password. This will be used in the following steps.

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
        credential_name => 'adw_db',
        username => 'ADMIN',
        password => '&lt;password&gt;'
      );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/adw-credential.png  " ")

7.  Run this code snippet by replacing the **object\_uri** with the **URL Path** you copied earlier. This copies the wallet path to the ATP's DATA\_PUMP\_DIR. When we create the database link in the next steps this wallet will be required.

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_CLOUD.GET_OBJECT(
            credential_name => 'adwc_token',
            object_uri => '&lt;your object file URI&gt;',
            directory_name => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/get-object.png  " ")

8.  From the downloaded ADW zip wallet file, make note of the following values from the tnsnames.ora file to a notepad which will be needed in this step. (It is recommended to use notepad if there is no application supported to open the file.)
    - hostname
    - service\_name
    - ssl\_server\_cert\_dn

    ![](./images/039.png  " ")

9.  Specify the **hostname**, **service_name** and **ssl\_server\_cert\_dn** values you noted earlier, to create a database link. This allows you to copy data from ADW to ATP (in fact, bi-directional).

    ````
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_CLOUD_ADMIN.CREATE_DATABASE_LINK(
              db_link_name => 'adwlink',
              hostname => '&lt;your ADW host&gt;',
              port => '1522',
              service_name => '&lt;your service name&gt;',
              ssl_server_cert_dn => '&lt;your cert&gt;',
              credential_name => 'adw_db',
              directory_name => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/database-link.png  " ")

10. Test the database link by retrieving the date from the remote ADW instance.

    ````
    <copy>
    select sysdate from dual@adwlink;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/adwlink-test.png  " ")

## **STEP 8:** Copy tables from ADW to ATP

1.  First, copy the credit\_scoring\_100k table into ML\_USER in ATP. Normally, this table would already exist in the production system. We could have loaded this table to ATP in lab 1 when we loaded the table into ADW. But, since we were going to create this database link, we can just copy it from ADW. Run the following statement to copy credit\_scoring\_100k table into ML\_USER in ATP.

    ````
    <copy>
    create table ml_user.credit_scoring_100k as select * from ml_user.credit_scoring_100k@adwlink;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/create-table.png  " ")

2.  We also need to copy the ml model, which is in the temp table (blob). To copy the temp table execute the following statement.

    ````
    <copy>
    create table ml_user.temp as select * from ml_user.temp@adwlink;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/create-mluser-temp.png  " ")

## **STEP 9:** Import the ML model

1.  Copy the SQL Developer URL from the browser and paste it in another tab. Change the user in the SQL Developer URL from ADMIN to **ml\_user** and hit enter to log in as ML\_USER. Copy the URL to a notepad - you will need it later.

    ![](./images/replace-admin.png  " ")

    ![](./images/ml-user-replaced.png  " ")

2.  Log in as ML\_USER, enter **Username - ML\_USER** and **Password** you created for the ATP Instance.

    ![](./images/mluser-signin.png  " ")

3. Dismiss the Help by clicking on the X in the popup.

    ![](./images/close-pop.png " ")

4.  Import your model and ignore the error message.

    ````
    <copy>
    DECLARE
    v_blob blob;
    BEGIN
    dbms_lob.createtemporary(v_blob, FALSE);
      select my_model into v_blob from temp;
    dbms_data_mining.import_sermodel(v_blob, 'N1_CLASS_MODEL');
    dbms_lob.freetemporary(v_blob);
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/import-model.png  " ")

5.  Confirm the ML model was imported.

    ````
    <copy>
    select * from user_mining_models;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/test-model.png  " ")

6.  Test the model.

    ````
    <copy>
    select prediction(N1_CLASS_MODEL USING 'Rich' as WEALTH, 2000 as income, 'Silver' as customer_value_segment) credit_prediction
    from dual;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/select-model.png  " ")

7.  To make the model prediction available to all applications we will use the Oracle Database's virtual column feature. We will add two new virtual columns - the prediction itself, and the probability that the prediction is correct. *TIP: You can also create a function index in the ml columns (not included here)*. If you wish to use a function index the table must be analyzed to be used in queries.

    ````
    <copy>
    alter table credit_scoring_100k add(
    likely_good_credit_pcnt AS (round((100*(prediction_probability(n1_class_model, 'Good Credit' USING
        wealth
      , customer_dmg_segment
      , income
      , highest_credit_card_limit
      , residental_status
      , max_cc_spent_amount_prev
      , max_cc_spent_amount
      , occupation
      , delinquency_status
      , customer_value_segment
      , residental_status))),1))
    , credit_prediction AS (prediction(n1_class_model USING   
      wealth
      , customer_dmg_segment
      , income
      , highest_credit_card_limit
      , residental_status
      , max_cc_spent_amount_prev
      , max_cc_spent_amount
      , occupation
      , delinquency_status
      , customer_value_segment
      , residental_status))
    );
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/alter-table.png  " ")

8.  Select some data to view predictions.

    ````
    <copy>
    select customer_id, wealth, income, credit_prediction, likely_good_credit_pcnt from credit_scoring_100k;
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/select-columns.png  " ")
