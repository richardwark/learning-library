# Provision and Register an Oracle Machine Learning Model into Oracle Analytics Cloud

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to provision an Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instance and establish a connection between the provisioned Oracle Autonomous Database instance and Oracle Analytics Cloud. Then you will register the Oracle Machine Learning model we created in the previous lab with Oracle Analytics Cloud, add the datasets from the ADB instance to Oracle Cloud Analytics so we can use the data in projects for visualization.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

Quick walk through on how to provision and register an Oracle Machine Learning model into Oracle Analytics Cloud.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Provision an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance
* Establish connection between the Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics Cloud
* Register the Oracle Machine Learning model with Oracle Analytics Cloud

### Prerequisites

* Provisioned an Autonomous Database instance
* Created a Oracle Machine Learning model

## **STEP 1**: Provision an Oracle Analytics Cloud Instance

1. In order to create an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance, you must login to the tenancy as a **Federated User**. Log out of Oracle Cloud and login again using Single Sign-On (SSO).

2. Enter your **Username** and **Password** and click **Sign In**.

    ![](./images/sso-login1.png " ")

3. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Analytics**, and select **Analytics Cloud**.

4. Under **Compartment**, make sure you select the same compartment you created the Good Wine Autonomous Database instance in. Then click **Create Instance**. 

    ![](./images/analytics-create-instance.png " ")

5. This bring up the **Create Analytics Instance** screen, specify the configuration of the instance:
    - **Name** - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. This lab uses **OACWINE** as the instance name.
    - **Description** - This is an optional field to add a description or note to remind yourself of what the instance is for. We added **Oracle Analytics Instance for Good Wine Workshop** for our own reference.
    - **Create in Compartment** - Select the compartment that houses the ADW Good Wine instance from Lab 1 in the drop-down list.

6. Leave **Capabilities**, **Network Access** and **Tagging** as default. Under **Licensing**, select **Bring Your Own License**. Then click **Create**.

7. Your Oracle Analytics instance will be displayed as orange while it's provisioning. Once it turns green, it's finished and ready to use!

## **STEP 2**: Download the Autonomous Database Instance Wallet

**Oracle Autonomous Database** will only accept secure connections to the database. This requires a **wallet** file that contains the SQL\*NET configuration files and the secure connection information. Wallets are used by client utilities such as SQL Developer, SQL\*Plus etc. For this workshop, you will use this same wallet mechanism to make a connection from **Oracle Autonomous Database** to **Oracle Analytics Cloud**.

1. First, you need to download the wallet file containing your credentials. From the hamburger menu, select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** and navigate to your Autonomous Database instance.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

    ![](./images/choose-adb-adw.png " ")

2. On the **Autonomous Database Details** page for your Autonomous Database, click the **DB Connection** button.

    ![](./images/db-connection.png " ")

3. This will open a pop-up window. Under **Wallet Type** select **Instance Wallet** and then click **Download Wallet**.

    ![](./images/download-wallet1.png " ")

    ### There are two types of wallets:

    - **Instance Wallet**: Wallet for a single database only; this provides a database-specific wallet

    - **Regional Wallet**: Wallet for all Autonomous Databases for a given tenant and region (this includes all service instances that a cloud account owns)

    > **Note**: Oracle recommends you provide a database-specific wallet, using Instance Wallet, to end users and for application use whenever possible. Regional wallets should only be used for administrative purposes that require potential access to all Autonomous Databases within a region.  
    

4. You will be asked to provide a **Password** for the wallet. The password must meet the rules for the **Oracle Cloud Password** complexity. This password is a password that you need to remember for your wallet. You can use the **OMLUSER Password** that you created before. Click **Download** and save the wallet to an accessible location.

    ![](./images/download-wallet-password.png " ")
 
5. You can now **Close** the **Database Connection** pop up window.

    ![](./images/close-wallet.png " ")

## **STEP 3**: Establish Connection Between the Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics Cloud


1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Analytics**, and select **Analytics Cloud**. 
	
	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/analytics-oac.png " ")

2. Under **Compartment**, make sure you select the compartment **OACWINE** is located in. Then in the OACWINE instance row, click the **Three Dots** to expand out the menu and select **Analytics Home Page**. Feel free to bookmark this page to navigate back to it easier.

    ![](./images/analytics-home-button.png " ")

3. On the top right-hand side of the screen, click **Create** and then select **Connection**.

    ![](./images/create-connection.png " ")

4. Choose **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![](./images/connect-adw.png " ")

5. Use the following information to configure your **Connection**. Then click **Save**.

    We recommend first selecting the Autonomous Database wallet zip file you just downloaded in the **Client Credentials** field. It will automatically extract the required **cwallet.sso** and then autocomplete the **Service Name** field for you.

    > **Connection Name**: GoodWineOAC
    >
    > **Description**: Leave it blank, or add whatever description you'd like.
    >
    > **Client Credentials**: Use the **Select..** button to upload the wallet zip file that you downloaded. It will automatically extract the cwallet.sso file from this zip bundle
    >
    > **Username**: OMLUSER
    >
    > **Password**: The password to the wallet you created
    > 
    > **Service Name**: Choose the name of your database followed by the \_high suffix

    ![](./images/register-model1.png " ")

2. Select **GoodWineOAC**, the connection you just created.
