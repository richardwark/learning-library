# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a new feature on Oracle Autonomous Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment. It is essential that Oracle provides adequate training content to introduce users to this technology and support the Oracle Machine Learning Data Scientist Certification Exam.

Estimated Lab Time: 120 minutes

### About Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of Oracle Autonomous Database, that includes Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD). By using Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks, you can run Python functions on data for data exploration and preparation while leveraging Oracle Database as a high-performance computing environment. Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is available through Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD) services.

### Objectives

This labs in this workshop focusses on the following:
* Oracle Machine Learning Notebook and connection to an Oracle Autonomous Database from a Python session
* Data selection and manipulation using the Transparency Layer
* In-database algorithms and models
* Datastores to store Python objects
* Embedded Python Execution
* AutoML functionality
