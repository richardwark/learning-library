## **Step 1**: Create an Oracle Machine Learning User

An administrator creates a new user account and user credentials for Oracle Machine Learning in the User Management interface.
> **Note:** You must have the administrator role to access the Oracle Machine Learning User Management interface. To create a user account:

1. On the Autonomous Database Details page, click **Service Console.**

    ![Service Console on the Autonomous Database Details page](images/service_console.png "Service Console")

2. On the Service Console click **Administration.**
    ![Autonomous Data Warehouse Administration page](images/administration.png "Administration")

3. Click **Manage Oracle ML Users** to open the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page.
    ![Manage OML Users option in Oracle Machine Learning Administration page](images/manage_oml_users.png "Manage OML Users option")
4. Click **Create** on the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page.
    <if type="freetier">![Users page in Oracle Machine Learning User Administration](images/create_option.png "Create User")</if>
    <if type="livelabs">![Users page in Oracle Machine Learning User Administration](images/create_option_livelabs.png "Create User")</if>

5. In the Create User page, enter the following details to create the user:
    ![Create User page](images/create_user_page.png "Create User page")
    <if type="freetier">
    - **Username:** Enter `omluser` for username. Using this username, the user will log in to an Oracle Machine Learning instance.
    - **First Name:** Enter the first name of the user.
    - **Last Name:**  Enter the first name of the user.
    - **Email Address:** Enter the email ID of the user.
    - Select the option **Generate password and email account details to user. User will be required to reset the password on first sign in.** to auto generate a temporary password and send an email with the account credentials to the user.
    If you select this option, you need not enter values in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields; the fields are grayed out.
    - **Password:** Enter a password for the user, if you choose to create a password for the user.
    This option is disabled if you select the Generate password... option to auto generate a temporary password for the user.
    - **Confirm Password:** Enter a password to confirm the value that you entered in the Password field.
    By doing so, you create the password for the user. The user can change the password when first logging in.
    </if>
    <if type="livelabs">
    - **Username:** Enter `omluser2` for username. You use this user later in the workshop to learn how to grant datastore access to a user.
    - **Email Address:** Enter an email ID for the user.
    - Untick the **Generate password and email account details to user. User will be required to reset the password on first sign in.** option.
    You do not select this option, because you want to specify your own password. If you select this option, you need not enter values in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields; the fields are grayed out.
    - **Password:** Enter `AAbbcc123456` for password.
    - **Confirm Password:** Enter the same password again.
    </if>

6. Click **Create.**

<if type="livelabs">
    ![List of users](images/omluser_2.png "List of users")
</if>

<if type="freetier">
7. Repeat step 5 and 6 to create `omluser2` user. You use this user later in the workshop to learn how to grant datastore access to a user.

### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

The Oracle Machine Learning notebooks toolbar contains buttons to run code in paragraphs, for configuration settings, and display options.

For example, it displays the current status and the number of users connected to the notebook. It also contains a menu item for keyboard shortcuts and options to show or hide the markdown editor and paragraph output. Additional settings are shown in the illustration here.
    ![Notebook toolbar](images/notebook_toolbar.png "Notebook toolbar")

Oracle Machine Learning notebooks contain an internal list of bindings to fetch data from the database or another data source, such as Oracle Cloud Object Storage. For this lab, we set the interpreter binding to connect to the ADW database and run queries.

Click the interpreter bindings icon in the upper right-corner of the Notebook to view the list of available interpreter bindings.
  ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Interpreter Bindings](images/interpreter_bindings.png "Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks  Interpreter Bindings")

The default service is low. Click to bind or unbind an interpreter. Drag-and-drop individual interpreter binding settings up or down to order which binding will be used by default. The first interpreter on the list becomes the default. Those highlighted in blue are active.

An interpreter is a plug-in that allows you to use a specific data processing language in your Oracle Machine Learning notebook. You can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL or Python.

You create different paragraphs with different interpreters based on the code you want to run in the paragraphs. The interpreter is set at the top of the paragraph.
The available interpreters are:

  - `%sql`&mdash;To call the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements
  - `%script`&mdash;To call and run PL/SQL scripts
  - `%md`&mdash;To call the Markdown interpreter and generate static html from Markdown plain text
  - `%python`&mdash;To call the Python interpreter and run Python scripts

<if type="livelabs">## **Step 5:** Connect to the Python Interpreter</if>
<if type="freetier">## **Step 6:** Connect to the Python Interpreter</if>

To run Python commands in a notebook, you must first connect to the Python interpreter. This occurs as a result of running your first `%python` paragraph. To use OML4Py, you must import the `oml` module, which automatically establishes a connection to your database.
In an Oracle Machine Learning notebook, you can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL or Python. This example shows you how to:

* Connect to a Python interpreter to run Python commands in a notebook
* Import the Python modules - oml, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
* Check if the `oml` module is connected to the database

**Note:** `z` is a reserved keyword and must not be used as a variable in `%python` paragraphs in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You will see `z.show()` used in the examples to display Python object and proxy object content.

1. Open the notebook and click the interpreter bindings icon. View the available interpreter bindings.  The "low" priority binding runs operations serially (no parallelism). You can drag-and-drop individual interpreter binding settings up or down to order which binding will be used by default. Those highlighted in blue are active. Click to toggle to inactive.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Interpreter Bindings](images/interpreter_bindings.png "Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks  Interpreter Bindings")

    The available interpreter bindings are:
    - `%sql`&mdash;To call the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements
    - `%script`&mdash;To call and run PL/SQL scripts
    - `%md`&mdash;To call the Markdown interpreter and generate static html from Markdown plain text
    - `%python`&mdash;To call the Python interpreter and run Python scripts

2. To connect to the Python interpreter, type `%python` at the top of a new paragraph in your notebook.
   You are now ready to run Python scripts in your notebook.

3. To use OML4Py module, you must import the oml module. Type the following Python command to import the `oml` module, and click the run icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the notebook.   

    ```
    %python
    <copy>import oml</copy>
    ```

    ![Python command to import oml module](images/import_oml.png "Python command to import oml module")

<if type="livelabs">## **Step 6:** Verify Connection to the Oracle Autonomous Database</if>
<if type="freetier">## **Step 7:** Verify Connection to the Oracle Autonomous Database</if>

Using the default interpreter bindings, OML Notebooks automatically establishes a database connection for the notebook.  

1. To verify the Python interpreter has established a database connection through the `oml` module, run the command:

    ```
    %python
    <copy>oml.isconnected()</copy>
    ```
    ![Database Connection Verification](images/oml_connected.png "Connection Verification")

    Once your notebook is connected, the command returns `True`.         


<if type="livelabs">## **Step 7:** View Help Files</if>
<if type="freetier">## **Step 8:** View Help Files</if>


The Python help function is used to display the documentation of packages, modules, functions, classes, and keywords. The help function has the following syntax:
    ```
    help([object])
    ```

For example,
  - To view the help files for the `oml.create` function, type:
    ```
    %python
    <copy>
    help(oml.create)</copy>
    ```

  - To view the help files for `oml` package, type:

    ```
    %python
    <copy>
    help(oml)</copy>
    ```
