# Introduction

## Introduction

Blockchain tables are append-only tables in which only insert operations are allowed. Deleting rows is either prohibited or restricted based on time. Rows in a blockchain table are made tamper-resistant by special sequencing & chaining algorithms. Users can verify that rows have not been tampered. A hash value that is part of the row metadata is used to chain and validate rows.

Blockchain tables enable you to implement a centralized ledger model where all participants in the blockchain network have access to the same tamper-resistant ledger. Blockchain tables are insert-only tables that organize rows into a number of chains. Each row in a chain, except the first row, is chained to the previous row in the chain by using a cryptographic hash to ensure that row can no longer be changed at a later date. A centralized ledger model in Oracle database 20c for Blockchain tables reduces administrative overheads of setting up a decentralized ledger network.
