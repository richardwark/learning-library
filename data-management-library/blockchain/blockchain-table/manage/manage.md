# Manage Blockchain Tables

## Introduction

In this lab we will create a blockchain table. Blockchain tables are append-only tables in which only insert operations are allowed. Deleting rows is either prohibited or restricted based on time. Rows in a blockchain table are made tamper-resistant by special sequencing & chaining algorithms. Users can verify that rows have not been tampered. A hash value that is part of the row metadata is used to chain and validate rows. Blockchain tables enable you to implement a centralized ledger model where all participants in the blockchain network have access to the same tamper-resistant ledger.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes


### Objectives


In this lab, you will:
* Create the Blockchain Table
* Describe and query blockchain table
* View all blockchain tables


### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a VCN
* Lab: Provision a 20c instance


## **STEP 1**: Create the Blockchain Table

1. Create the blockchain table named `bank_ledger`. Rows can never be deleted in the blockchain table `bank_ledger`. Moreover the blockchain table can be dropped only after 16 days of inactivity. 

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE BLOCKCHAIN TABLE bank_ledger (bank VARCHAR2(128), deposit_date DATE, deposit_amount NUMBER)
          NO DROP UNTIL 16 DAYS IDLE
          NO DELETE LOCKED
          HASHING USING "SHA2_512" VERSION "v1";
    ```
  The blockchain table has been created. 

## **STEP 2:** Describe and Query Blockchain Table

1. At this time you can look at your table. Describe and query blockchain table:

    ```
    <copy>
    DESC bank_ledger;

    select * from USER_BLOCKCHAIN_TABLES;

    select bank, deposit_date, deposit_amount, ORABCTAB_INST_ID$, ORABCTAB_CHAIN_ID$, ORABCTAB_SEQ_NUM$, ORABCTAB_CREATION_TIME$, ORABCTAB_USER_NUMBER$, ORABCTAB_HASH$, ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE$, ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE_ALG$, ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE_CERT$ from bank_ledger;
  ```

## **STEP 3:** View all blockchain tables

1. View all the blockchain tables in your current database:
    
    ```
    <copy>
    select * from dba_blockchain_tables;  
    ```

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
