network security, including a Virtual Cloud Network
(VNC).

* Monitor the health of your resources, optimize the
performance of your applications, and respond to
anomalies in real time.

* Access to dozens of additional Oracle Cloud Services
enabling organizations to embrace the shift to the cloud.
