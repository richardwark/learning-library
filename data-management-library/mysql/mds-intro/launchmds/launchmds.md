    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute03.png " ")

   For VCN make sure **MDS_VCN** is selected, "Assign a public IP address" should be set to Yes.  
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute04.png " ")

7. If you have not already created your SSH key, perform "Lab 1: Create Local SSH Key".  When you are done return to the next line (STEP 5: #8) .
8. In the Add SSH keys section, generate an SSH key pair or upload your own public key. Select one of the following options: 
* **Generate SSH keys:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure generates an RSA key pair for the instance. Click Save Private Key, and then save the private key on your computer. Optionally, click Save Public Key and then save the public key.
* **Generate SSH keys:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure generates an RSA key pair for the instance. Click Save Private Key, and then save the private key on your computer. Optionally, click Save Public Key and then save the public key.  
* **Choose SSH key files:** Upload the public key portion of your key pair. Either browse to the key file that you want to upload, or drag and drop the file into the box. To provide multiple keys, press and hold down the Command key (on Mac) or the CTRL key (on Windows) while selecting files.
* **Paste SSH keys:** Paste the public key portion of your key pair in the box.
* **No SSH keys:** Do NOT select this option! You will not be able to connect to the Compute Instance using SSH.
  
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute06.png " ")

9. The New Virtual Machine will be ready to use after a few minutes. The state will be shown as Provisioning during the creation
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute07.png " ")

10.	The state Running indicates that the Virtual Machine is ready to use. 

    **Save the Public IP Address** under "Instance Access"  on the **MDS_Client** Instance page. 
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute08.png " ")

## **STEP 6:** Connect to MySQL Database

1. If you are a Linux, Mac, or  Windows 10 Powershell user go to STEP 6: #2

   If you are a Windows user click Start menu from your windows machine for Git which should include the Git Bash command.

    Click on the Git Bash command. This will take you to the Git Bash terminal as shown below 
    
    and continue to  STEP 6: #2. 
    ![Connect](./images/06connect0.png" ")

2.  From a terminal window on your local system. Connect to the Compute Instance with the SSH command. 

    Indicate the location of the private key you created earlier with **MDS_Client**. 
    
    Enter the username **opc** and the Public **IP Address**.

    Note: The **MDS_Client**  shows the  Public IP Address as mentioned on Step 5: #10
    
    (Example: **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&132.145.170.990**)

    `$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&<your_compute_instance_ip>;`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect01.png " ")

3. You will need a MySQL client tool to connect to your new MySQL DB System from your client machine. 

    Install MySQL release package  with the following command:

    `[opc@...]$ sudo yum -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect03.png " ")

    Install MySQL Shell with the following command 

    `[opc@...]$ sudo yum install –y mysql-shell`
    ![Connect](./images/06connect05.png " ")
 
4. From your Compute instance, connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. 
    
   The endpoint (IP Address) can be found in the MySQL DB System Details page, under the "Endpoints" resource. 

    ![Connect](./images/06connect06.png " ")

5.  Use the following command to connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool.

    (Example  **mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h132.145.170.990**)
    
    `[opc@...]$ mysqlsh -u<MDS_admin_username> -p -h<MDS_endpoint>`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect07.png " ")

6. On MySQL Shell, switch to SQL mode  to try out some SQL commands 

    Type the following command at the prompt:
    
    `\SQL`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect13.png " ")

    To display a list of databases, type the following command at the prompt:
   
    `SHOW DATABASES;`
    
    To display the database version, current_date, and user type the following command at the prompt:

    `SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE, USER();`

    To display MysQL user and host from user table type the following command at the prompt:
    
    `SELECT USER, HOST FROM mysql.user;`

7. (Optional) At this point, you can also use MySQL Workbench from your local machine to connect to the MySQL endpoint using your new Compute instance as a jump box. 

   In your pre installed MySQL Workbench, 
   
   configure a connection using the method "Standard TCP/IP over SSH" 
   
   and use the credentials of the Compute instance for SSH.

## **STEP 7:** Start, stop, or reboot MySQL DB System

Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Databases**, and select **DB Systems**.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-dbsys.png " ")

List DB Systems
![MDS](./images/04mysql02_06.png " ")
Choose  **MDS_Sandbox** Compartment 

Click **MDS_DB** to open the DB System details page
![MDS](./images/04mysql07.png " ")

Select one of the following actions:
* Start: Starts a stopped DB System. After the DB System is started, the Stop action is enabled and the Start option is disabled.
* Stop: Stops a running DB System. After the DB System is powered off, the Start action is enabled.
* Restart: Shuts down a DB System, and restarts it.

**Note**  Stopping a DB System stops billing for all OCPUs associated with it. 
* Billing continues for storage. 
* Billing for OCPUs resumes if you restart the DB System.
* If you selected Stop or Restart, the Stop/Restart MySQL DB System dialog is displayed.

Select a shutdown type:
* Fast: Flushes dirty pages before shutting down the DB System. 

    Some flush operations must be performed during next startup, potentially increasing the duration of the startup process.
* Slow: Flushes dirty pages and purges undo log pages for older transactions. 
    
    The shutdown itself can take longer, but the subsequent startup is faster.
* Immediate: Does not flush dirty pages and does not purge any undo log pages. 
    Stops MySQL immediately. Page flushes and log purging will take place during the next startup, increasing the duration of the startup process.

Select the required shutdown type and click the Stop or Restart button, depending on the action chosen.

## **STEP 8:** Delete MySQL DB System

Deleting a DB System permanently deletes it. Any manual backups associated with the deleted DB System are retained for their retention periods. Automatic backups are deleted with the DB System.

Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Databases**, and select **DB Systems**.
