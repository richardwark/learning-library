# Launch Your First MySQL Database Service With HeatWave System

## About this Workshop

MySQL Database Service with HeatWave for real-time analytics delivers the worldâ€™s most popular open-source database on OCI at a fraction of other cloud vendors costs. HeatWave scales to thousands of cores and is 2.7x faster than Amazon Redshift, at 1/3 of the cost. MySQL Database Service is the same MySQL Enterprise Edition that you know and use, now available in the cloud as a fully-managed service running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. HeatWave is a distributed, scalable, shared-nothing, in-memory, columnar, query processing engine designed for fast execution of analytic queries. It is enabled when you add a HeatWave cluster to a MySQL Database Service (MDS) System. 

In this workshop you will learn how to create and use MySQL Database Service with HeatWave on OCI, load and update data into the HeatWave cluster, run queries, and use MySQL Shell and Workbench to connect with HeatWave.

Estimated Lab Time: 4 hours

### About Product/Technology
Oracle MySQL Database Service, with HeatWave, is the only service that enables database admins and app developers to run OLTP and OLAP workloads directly from their MySQL database, eliminating the need for complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. 

MySQL Database Service with HeatWave is a fully managed service,
running on Oracle Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure. It enables
you to:

* Instantly provision MySQL instances and connect to a
production ready, pre-configured MySQL database.

* Automate database specific tasks such as configuration,
security patching, backup, HA, and monitoring.

* Choose from multiple compute shapes, depending on
your application and capacity requirements.

* Provision fast, reliable, and secure cloud storage for all
enterprise workloads.

* Set up fast, predictable networking with end-to-end
network security, including a Virtual Cloud Network
(VNC).

* Monitor the health of your resources, optimize the
performance of your applications, and respond to
anomalies in real time.

* Access to dozens of additional Oracle Cloud Services
enabling organizations to embrace the shift to the cloud.

* Free up time of developers, DBAs, and DevOps to focus
on value added tasks that are core to your business.
