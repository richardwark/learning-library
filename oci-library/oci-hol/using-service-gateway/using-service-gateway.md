#  Using Service Gateway 

## Introduction

If you're a typical Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer, you may have resources in your virtual cloud network (VCN) that need to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service, which has publicly addressable endpoints. Until now, you could use either public subnets or a NAT instance, with an internet gateway in your VCN to access the service. However, you might not have wanted to use these options because of privacy, security, or operational concerns.

Service Gateway alleviates the preceding concerns by enabling the following functions:

- Private connectivity between your VCNs and Object Storage: You can add a service gateway to a VCN and use the VCN's private address space to access Object Storage without exposing the instances to the public internet. You don't need a public subnet, NAT instance, or internet gateway in your VCN. 

- Enhanced security for your Object Storage buckets: You can limit access to Object Storage buckets from an authorized VCN or from a specific range of IP addresses within the subnet. You can add  conditional references to VCN and IP addresses in IAM policies, which can only be satisfied when you initiate connections through a service gateway

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_015.PNG " ")

15. In Order to ssh into private instance we will use the ssh proxy command. This command allows us to âtunnelâ through the bastion host to our private instance. Storing private SSH keys on a public server such as a Bastion host(First Compute instance) is not recommended.

16. Ensure you have both the Public IP of first compute and Private IP of second compute. In git-bash window ensure you are in **/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh** directory. Enter Command:

    ```
    <copy>
    bash 
    ssh -t -o ProxyCommand='ssh -i <SSH_Private_Key_Name> opc@<FIRST_COMPUTE_PUBLIC_IP> -W %h:%p %r' -i <SSH_Private_Key_Name> opc@<SECOND_COMPUTE_PRIVATE_IP>
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_034.PNG " ")

17. Enter Yes at Security Prompt.

18. Check oci CLI installed version, Enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    oci -v
    </copy>
    ```
    **NOTE:** Version shoudl be minimum 2.4.2X

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_005.PNG " ")

19. Next we will configure OCI CLI. Enter command: 
    ```
    <copy>
    oci setup config
    </copy>
    ```

20. Accept the default directory location. For user OCI switch to OCI Console window. Click Human Icon and then your user name. In the user details page Click **copy** to copy the OCID. **Also note down your region name as shown in OCI Console window**. Paste the OCID in ssh session.

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_004.PNG " ")

21. Repeat the step to find tenancy OCID (Human icon followed by Clicking Tenancy Name). Paste the Tenancy OCID in ssh session to compute instance followe by providing your region name (us-ashburn-1, us-phoneix-1 etc).

22. When asked for **Do you want to generate a new RSA key pair?** answer Y. For the rest of the question accept default by pressing Enter.

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_005.PNG " ")

## **Step 3:** Upload API keys, and verify functionality

1. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :

    ```
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
    </copy>
    ```

2. Hightligh and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followe by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_006.PNG " ")

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_007.PNG " ")

3. A new finger print will be generated. Switch to git-bash window and enter command
    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/opc/.oci/config
    </copy>
    ```
    Compare the finger print in the output of config file to 
    the one in OCI console window and make sure they match.

    ***We will now upload an object to object storage and access it from second compute instance. This download will use the Public IP of Compute Instance***

4. Switch back to OCI Console window and navigate to your Object Storage bucket details page. Note down the name space and object storage name

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_032.PNG " ")

5. Switch to git-bash window (ssh session to second compute instance) and download samplefile. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    `bash
    oci os object get --namespace <NAME_SPACE> --bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --name samplefile --file ./
    </copy>
    ```

    **HINT:** In this example the command will be:
    oci os object get --namespace us_training --bucket-name
    Service-Gateway-Bucket --name samplefile --file ./samplefile

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_021.PNG " ")

6. No output will be displayed and no file will be downloaded. Enter Ctrl+C to terminate the command. Enter command 

    ```
    <copy>
    ls
    </copy>
    ```
    and verify samplefile was not downloaded.

    **Since there is no Public IP on the second compute instance it can not access Object storage. Next will initialize the route table and re-download the file.** 

7. Switch to OCI console. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking. Locate your VCN and Click the VCN name to display VCN details. 

8. Click **Route tables**, and Click **Default Route Table for `<VCN_NAME>`**. 

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_003.PNG " ")

9. Click **Add Route Rules**. Fill out the dialog box:

    - **TARGET TYPE:**  Service Gateway
    - **DESTINATION SERVICE:** OCI IAD-ObjectStorage
    - **COMPARTMENT:** Choose the assigned compartment
    - **TARGET SERVICE GATEWAY:** Choose the service Gateway created earlier.

10.  Click **Add Route Rules**, new route entry should be created.

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_035.PNG " ")

11. In Your VCN , Click **Security Lists**, then **Default Security List for `<VCN_NAME>`** . Click **Add Egress Rules**.

12. Add following Egress rule; Ensure to leave STATELESS flag un-checked.

    - **DESTINATION TYPE:** Service
    - **DESTINATION SERVICE:** OCI IAD Object Storage
    - **SOURCE PORT RANGE:** ALL
    - **DESTINATION PORT RANGE:** ALL

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_036.PNG " ")

13. Click **Add Egress Rules**.

14. Switch to git-bash window (with ssh to second compute instance).

15. Re-enter download command:
    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    oci os object get --namespace <NAME_SPACE> --bucket-name<BUCKET_NAME> --name samplefile --file ./
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./../using-service-gateway/images/SGW_029.PNG " ")

Using Servie Gateway, compute instance was able to access Object stored in Object Storage. This was done using the private backbone network of OCI rather than public internet.

##  Step 4: Delete the resources
**NOTE:**  As a practice user will need to figure out any errors encountered during deletion of resources.

1. Switch to  OCI console window.

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**.

3. Locate compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminate**.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG " ")

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG " ")

5. Repeat steps to delete the second compute instance.

6. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will appear.

7. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0018.PNG " ")

8. From OCI services menu navigate to **OBject Storage**. Click your bucket name. Under **Objects** your file should be visible. Click the Action icon (3 vertical dots) and click **Delete** to delete the object.

9. Once the Object is deleted, click **Delete** to delete the bucket.
