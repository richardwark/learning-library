## Deploying MySQL InnoDB Cluster on OCI with Terraform

*ODL Hands-on Lab - October 2020*

MySQL InnoDB Cluster provides a complete, high-availability solution for MySQL. MySQL Shell includes AdminAPI, which enables you to easily configure and administer a group of at least three MySQL server instances to function as an InnoDB cluster. Each MySQL server instance runs MySQL Group Replication, which provides the mechanism to replicate data within InnoDB clusters, with built-in failover.

During this lab you will learn how to deploy MySQL InnoDB Cluster on OCI using Terraform and Resource Manager's stacks.
