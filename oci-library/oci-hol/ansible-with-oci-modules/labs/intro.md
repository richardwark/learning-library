# Introduction

Get hands-on learning with training labs about Oracle cloud solutions. The workshops featured cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Ansible

OCI supports the use of Ansible modules to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and configuration, orchestration of complex operational processes, and deployment and update of your software assets. Ansible playbooks automate configuration, deployment, and orchestration tasks. Ansible tracks your resources using inventory lists.

This lab will demonstrate both provisioning and configuration of your infrastructure. You will first provision a set of infrastructure resources with a single Ansible playbook. Next, you will leverage Ansible's Dynamic Inventory functionality to fetch the details of the current infrastructure and deploy Apache (the configuration management aspect). You would be doing all of it using your Ansible playbooks, leveraging the ‘Infrastructure as code’ paradigm.
