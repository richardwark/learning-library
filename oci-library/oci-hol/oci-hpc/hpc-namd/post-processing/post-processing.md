# Post-processing

## Introduction
In this lab, you will use Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software to analyze the models for post-processing.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

## **STEP**: Post-processing

1. For post-processsing, you can use Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software to analyze the models. Run the following commands to configure VMD:

    ```
    <copy>
    ./configure
    cd src
    sudo make install
    </copy>
    ```

2. If you are using vnc, launch vncserver and create a vnc password as follows:

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo systemctl start vncserver@:1.service
    sudo systemctl enable vncserver@:1.service
    vncserver
    vncpasswd
    </copy>
    ```

3. Start up a vnc connection using localhost:5901 (ensure tunneling is configured), and run the following commands to start up VMD:

    ```
    <copy>
    vmd
    </copy>
    ```

4. Open the apoa1 and stmv pdb files in /mnt/block/work/NAMD_models and start playing with your models.
