# Access your Cluster

## Introduction

In this lab, you will access your cluster.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab:
* We will demonstrate how to access your High Performance Computing(HPC) Cluster Network on OCI

### Prerequisites

* Complete Lab 3 : Launch HPC cluster
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful
* Familiarity with networking is helpful

## **STEP 1**: Access your Cluster

1. The public IP address of the bastion can be found on the lower left menu under Outputs. If you navigate to your instances in the main menu, you will also find your bastion instance as well as the public IP.

2. The Private Key to access the machines can also be found there. Copy the text in a file on your machine, let's say/home/user/key:

    ```
    <copy>
    chmod 600 /home/user/key 
    ssh -i /home/user/key opc@ipaddress 
    </copy>
    ```
