# Introduction

Ever found yourself in a situation where you have an umbrella and no rain or late at night in a parking lot with no snowbrush because you were given what you consider to be misinformation? Are you tired of your local weatherman predicting the weather incorrectly and you want to do something about it? Well, this is a lab you may find value in. Today we are going to discuss and guide you through how to set up and run WRF on OCI infrastructure. I'll also provide a script just incase you want to run WRF without learning how to set it up.

Estimated lab time: 90 minutes

### About WRF

WRF is the abbreviation for The Weather Research and Forecasting Model. It is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. WRF exists today do to a partnership that began in the late 90â€™s between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (represented by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the Earth System Research Laboratory), the U.S. Air Force, the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). WRF is open-source and is available on github.
WRF allows researchers to simulate the weather using either real data that has been collected via observations and analyses or idealized atmospheric conditions. WRF provides operational forecasting a platform, where many contributors have helped to make advances in physics, numerics, and data assimilation. WRF is currently in operational use at NCEP and other forecasting centers internationally which is a pretty big deal.
