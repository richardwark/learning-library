# Accessing a VNC

## Introduction
In this lab, you will access your VNC.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

## **STEP**: Access your VNC

1. We will connect through an SSH tunnel to the instance. On your machine, connect using ssh PORT below will be the number that results from 5900 + N. N is the display number, if the output for N was 1, PORT is 5901, if the output was 9, PORT is 5909 public_ip is the public IP address of the headnode, which is running the VNC server. If you used the previous instructions, port will be 5901
    ```
    <copy>
        ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 opc@public_ip
    </copy>
    
    ```

2. You can now connect using any VNC viewer using localhost:N as VNC server and the password you set during the vnc installation. You can chose a VNC client that you prefer or use this guide to install on your local machine:
