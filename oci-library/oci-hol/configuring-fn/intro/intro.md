# Introduction
## Introduction
Get hands-on learning with training labs about Oracle cloud solutions. The workshops featured cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This workshop involves multiple components of the Oracle Cloud including the OCI Load Balancing Service, Networking, Compute and Oracle Cloud Shell.  

Estimated workshop time: 90 minutes

### Oracle Functions

The Oracle Functions service provides a way for developers to run code without worrying about hardware, operating systems, language runtimes, or containers. Oracle Functions are serverless and do not require infrastructure administration. There is no need to worry about instances or software patches/upgrades. Oracle Functions allow your app to be highly-available, scalable, secure, and monitored.

Oracle Functions are based on the open source [Fn Project](https://fnproject.io/). The Fn Project is an event driven Function as a Service(FaaS) platform. This makes Oracle Functions platform independent. You can even develop and test your function locally before deploying to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Functions can be written in python, java,  go, node.js, ruby, or even other languages. The event driven nature of Oracle Functions also means that customers are only charged for execution time when a function is triggered and not for idle time.

Watch the video below for a quick overview of Oracle Functions.
