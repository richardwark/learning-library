## Overview

In this lab we will create Docker registry in OCI, we will then install Docker on a 
compute instance and push and pull images to/from this registry.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry is an Oracle-managed registry that enables you to simplify your development to production workflow. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry makes it easy for you as a developer to store, share, and manage development artifacts like Docker images. And the highly available and scalable architecture of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ensures you can reliably deploy your applicationsYou can use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry as a private Docker registry for internal use, pushing and pulling Docker images to and from the Registry using the Docker V2 API and the standard Docker command line interface (CLI). You can also use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry as a public Docker registry, enabling any user with internet access and knowledge of the appropriate URL to pull images from public repositories in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)  

## Practice-1: Sign in to OCI Console and create VCN and Docker Registry


**Note:** OCI UI is being updated thus some screenshots in the instructions might be different than actual UI

**Before You Begin**

- We recommend using Chrome or Edge as the broswer. Also set your browser zoom to 80%

1. Sign in using your tenant name, user name and password.

2. Once signed in select the compartment assigned to you from drop down menu on left part of the screen

3. From the OCI Services menu,click **Virtual Cloud Network** under Networking and click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

**NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list

11. From OCI Services menu, click **Registry(OCIR)** under **Developer Services**
 
12. Click **Create Repository**. Provide Repository name (all Lowercase), Check **Public** and click **Submit**
![]( img/OCIR_HOL0012.PNG)

13.  Once created, verify there are no existing images in 
the repository (as shown in OCI console)

***We now have a Docker registry and Auth token (to validate login to the registry). Next we will create a Public/Private key pair and then compute instance to test pushing and pulling images from the registry.***

## Practice 2: Create ssh keys and compute instance

1. Open built in Git bash application and generate ssh keys

2. Click the Apps icon in the toolbar and select  Git-Bash to open a terminal window.

3. Enter command:
```
ssh-keygen
```
**HINT:** You can swap between OCI window, 
git-bash sessions and any other application (Notepad, etc.) by clicking the Switch Window icon

4. Press Enter When asked for ‘Enter File in which to save the key’, ‘Created Directory, ‘Enter passphrase’, and ‘Enter Passphrase again.
![]( img/RESERVEDIP_HOL008.PNG)

5. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)
/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command: (No Spaces)
 ```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
 and then 
 ```
 ls
 ```
to verify the two files exist. 

6. In git-bash Enter command:
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
, highlight the key and copy

8. Switch to the OCI console. From OCI servies menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute** 

9. Click Create Instance. Fill out the dialog box:

- **Name:** Enter a name 

- **Availability Domain:** Select the first available domain.(usually AD1)

- **Image Operating System:** For the image, we recommend using the Latest Oracle Linux available.

- **Choose Instance Type:** Select Virtual Machine

- **Choose Instance Shape:** Select VM.Standard.E.2.1

- **Configure Boot Volume:** Leave the default

- **Add SSH Keys:** Choose ‘Paste SSH Keys’ and paste the Public Key saved earlier.

- **Virtual Cloud Network Compartment:** Choose your compartment

- **Virtual Cloud Network:** Select the VCN you created in the previous section. 

- **Subnet Compartment:** Choose your compartment. 

- **Subnet:** Choose the first Subnet

10. Click **Create**

**NOTE:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different shape such as VM.Standard.E2.2 OR VM.Standard2.2

***Next we will ssh to the compute instance and install Docker.***

## Practice 3: SSH to Compute Instance install Docker and push images to registry

1. In git-bash type cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh

2. Enter command
```
ls
```
and verify id_rsa file exists

3. Enter command 
```
ssh –i id_rsa opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>
```
**NOTE:** User name is opc

**HINT:** If ‘Permission denied error’ is seen, ensure you are using ‘-i’ in the ssh command

4. Enter ‘Yes’ when prompted for security message

docker image pull alpine
``` 
Verify image pull was successful, Enter Command 
```
Docker images
``` 
and verify alpine is present
![]( img/OCIR_HOL0024.PNG)

14. Now we will push this image to Docker registry created in OCI. First login to Registry in OCI. Enter command 
```
docker login <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io
```
**NOTE:** Region name code are, fra for Frankfurt, iad for Ashburn, lhr for London, phx for Phoenix.

15. Verify Login Succeeded message is displayed.

16. Next we will tag the image that we pulled from the web. Enter command 
```
docker images
``` 
and note down the image id of alpine. Enter command: (No Spaces)
```
docker tag <image_id>  <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<TenancyName>/<docker_registry_name>:<image_name> 
```
17. Verify the tag was created, Enter command 
```
docker images
``` 
and verify version x.y.test is present. x and y will be the numeric version number)

**NOTE:** In below example:

- <image_id> is **3fd9065eaf02** 

- <Region_Name_Code> is **iad** 

- <Tenancy_Name> is **us_training** 

- <docker_registry_name> is **docker-test-image**

- <image_name> is **version4.0.test**  
![]( img/OCIR_HOL0028.PNG)

18. We will now push the image to docker registry in OCI. 
Enter command: 
```
docker push <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<Tenancy_Name>/<docker_registry_name>:<image_name>** (No Spaces)
```
**NOTE:** In below example:
- <Region_Name_Code> is **iad**
- <Tenancy_Name> is **us_training**
- <docker_registry_name> is **docker-test-image**
- <image_name> is **version4.0.test**
