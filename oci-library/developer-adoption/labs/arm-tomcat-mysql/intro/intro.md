# Deploy Java applications on Ampere A1 on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Estimated time: 45 minutes
Note : This lab can be performed on a Free Trial, Always-Free Tier, or paid subscription accounts. 

Learn how to build and deploy Java applications as containers on the Ampere A1 compute platform in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI). You will deploy a Todo application with a database, as containers running on the Ampere A1 compute platform. Additionally, you will use the new set of container tools such as [Podman](podman.io) that are available in Oracle Linux 8.0.


Estimated time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will:

* Create an Ampere A1 compute instance. 
* Build a Java EE application that manages Todo notes.
* Deploy the application to Tomcat 9.
* Connect the application to a database and manage the deployment as a Pod. 
* Run and test the application.
* Clean up the deployments.

### Prerequisites

1. An Oracle Free Tier (Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account.
1. [Familiarity with OCI console](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/console.htm)
1. [Overview of Networking](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm)
1. [Familiarity with Compartments](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
1. Basic conceptual knowledge of containers and [Podman](https://podman.io/)
1. Keep SSH keys handy. If you don't have keys, [generate SSH keys](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/generate_ssh_keys/index.html).
