## Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service is an internet-scale, high-performance storage platform that offers reliable and cost-efficient data durability. The Object Storage service can store an unlimited amount of unstructured data of any content type, including analytic data and rich content, like images and videos.

With Object Storage, you can safely and securely store or retrieve data directly from the internet or from within the cloud platform. Object Storage offers multiple management interfaces that let you easily manage storage at scale.

Object Storage is a regional service and is not tied to any specific compute instance. You can access data from anywhere inside or outside the context of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

**Object storage offers 2 tiers:**

1- Use Standard for data to which you need fast, immediate, and frequent access. Data accessibility and performance justifies a higher price point to store data in the Object Storage

2- Use Archive for data to which you seldom or rarely access, but that must be retained and preserved for long periods of time. The cost efficiency of the Archive Storagetier offsets the long lead time required to access the data

The purpose of this lab is to give you an overview of the Object Service and an example scenario to help you understand how the service works.

14.  An option to download the file will appear.

**NOTE:** Do NOT download the file as due to space restrictions it is not allowed for the purpose of this lab.

***You have uploaded an object to Object Storage bucket, created a pre-authenticated link and successfully accessed the object. The Pre-Authenticated link can be shared with 
other users to provide them access to the object.
Multiple objects of any size can be uploaded to the bucket and shared across teams/users.***
