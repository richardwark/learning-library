# Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing

## Overview

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet the demands of mission critical applications.

Autonomous Transaction Processing provides all of the performance of the market-leading Oracle Database in an environment that is tuned and optimized to meet the demands of a variety of applications, including: mission-critical transaction processing, mixed transactions and analytics, IoT, and JSON document store.

As a service Autonomous Transaction Processing does not require database administration. With Autonomous Transaction Processing you do not need to configure or manage any hardware, or install any software. Autonomous Transaction Processing handles creating the database, backing up the database, patching and upgrading the database, and growing or shrinking the database.

This template creates a shared Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.
