# Create Pages for Business Objects
## Introduction

This lab shows you how to create web pages to display the business objects you created in the previous tutorial, _Create a Web Application in Oracle Visual Builder_, and how to create new instances of the business objects.

Estimated Lab Time:  15 minutes

### Background

In the previous tutorial, you created three business objects to hold your application's data. As a refresher, here's the Location, Department, and Employee business objects you created  previously:

In this tutorial, you'll create web pages that display the data from these business objects in tables. Quick Starts help you specify how to display business object data. A table component offers several Quick Starts that add buttons and pages to create, view, edit, and delete business object data.

In this tutorial, you'll create one page to display departments and another to display employees. You'll also add a **Create** button to each page to let your users create a new department or a new employee (in other words, to create a new instance of the business object).  The button is associated with an _event_, and the event sets off an _action chain_, which is a sequence of actions that the application executes.

## **STEP 1**: Use the main-start Page to Display Departments

These steps assume that you are already logged in to Oracle Visual Builder and are viewing the HR Application you created.

1.  Click the **Web Applications** ![Web Applications icon](./images/vbcscp_webapp_icon.png) tab in the Navigator.
2.  Expand the **Flows** and **main** nodes if necessary, then click **main-start**, the page that was automatically created for your web application. You're viewing the Page Designer, with the Components palette visible.

    You may want to click the **Web Applications** tab to close the Web Apps pane and create more room. You may also want to widen your browser window.

3.  In the Components palette, locate the **Heading** component under Common and drag it onto the page.

4.  Click **Properties** to open the Heading's Properties pane, then enter `Departments` in the **Text** field.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s4.png)

5.  In the Components palette, scroll down to **Collection** and drag a **Table** component onto the page below the heading. You'll use this table to display three fields from the department business object: the id, name, and location.

6.  In the Properties pane, click **Add Data** to open the Add Data Quick Start.  

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s6.png)

7.  On the Locate Data page of the Quick Start, select the **Department** business object, then click **Next**.  

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s7.png)

8.  On the Bind Data page, under **item\[i\]**, select the **id** and **name** check boxes (in that order).

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s8.png)

9.  Expand the **locationObject** and **items** nodes (**item\[i\]** is expanded automatically) and select **name** to enable the location name to appear in the table. Click **Next**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s9.png)

10.  On the Define Query page, click **Finish**.  

    A Departments table with three empty columns is displayed on the main-start page. Notice that the second Name column (which maps to the location name field) shows simply as Name.

11.  To make the location name column descriptive, click the **Data** tab. Under **Table Columns**, click the ![Column Detail icon](./images/vbcscp_columndetail_icon.png) **Column Detail** arrow next to **Name (locationObject)**.  

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s11.png)

12.  In the **Columns, Header Text** field, change `Name` to `Location`, then click ![Back to Table icon](./images/vbcscp_backtotable_icon.png) **Table** to return to the main **Data** tab.  

    ![](./images/vbcscp_dd_s12.png)

    The main-start page now has a table with three columns: Id, Name, and Location. You won't see any information in your table because we are yet to import data for the Department business object.


## **STEP 2**: Add a Create Page for the Department Business Object

A Create page allows you to populate your table with data by creating new instances of a business object.

1.  Select the table if necessary, click the **Quick Start** tab, then click **Add Create Page**.
2.  On the Select Endpoint page, select the **Department** business object, if necessary, and click **Next**.
3.  On the Page Detail page, under Endpoint Structure, select the **location** check box (the **name** check box is already selected, because name is a required field). These are the only fields the user needs to specify.
4.  Change the **Button label** field to `Create`. Leave the other values set to their defaults. Click **Finish**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpd_s4.png)

    A **Create** button appears in a **Toolbar** component above the table on the main-start page. (Click next to the button to see the Toolbar component.) Click the **Web Applications** tab to see the main-create-department page created in the pages list under **Flows** and **main**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpd_s4_result.png)

5.  Click the **main-create-department** page in the Navigator to open it in the Page Designer.

    The page created by the Quick Start has a form for you to enter the fields you specified. It also has two buttons.

6.  In the Page Designer toolbar, click **Live** to make the form active. Click **Properties** to make room for the form.

    To indicate that you are in Live view, the **Live** button now has a green background, and a green line appears around the page.

7.  Enter `Administration` in the **Name** field, and select **Floor 1** from the **Location** drop-down list.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpd_s7.png)

    Click **Save**. A message appears briefly, and Oracle Visual Builder places you in the main page flow of your application, where you can see that the main-start page points to the main-create-department page. The arrow means that you can navigate from one page to the other.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpd_s7_result.png)

    By convention, a page name has its flow name as a prefix. This simple application uses only the main flow. More complex applications can have more than one flow.

8.  Open the **main-start** page (you can either click the tab above the page canvas or click the page in the Navigator), then click **Reload page** ![Reload page icon](./images/vbcscp_reload_icon.png), if necessary, to see the table row you created.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpd_s8.png)

9.  Click **Design** to return to Design view.

## **STEP 3**: Add a Page to Display Employees

In this step, you'll create a page to display employees, similar to the one you created for departments.

1.  In the Web Apps tree, under **hrwebapp** and **Flows**, click **+** (Create Page) next to the **main** node.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpe_s1.png)

2.  In the Create Page dialog box, enter `employees` in the **Page ID** field after `main-` and click **Create**. The main-employees page opens in the Page Designer.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpe_s2.png)

3.  In the Components palette, locate the **Heading** component under Common and drag it onto the page.
4.  Click the **Properties** tab, then in the Properties pane, enter `Employees` in the **Text** field.
5.  In the Components palette, scroll down to Collection and drag a **Table** component onto the page.
6.  Click **Add Data**.
7.  On the Locate Data page, select the **Employee** business object and click **Next**.
8.  On the Bind Data page, select the **id**, **name**, **hireDate**, and **email** check boxes under **item\[i\]**. The columns appear in the order selected; if you want to change the order, drag a **Handle** ![Handle icon](./images/vbcscp_handle_icon.png) to reorder the columns as desired.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpe_s8.png)

9.  Expand the **departmentObject** and **items** nodes (**item\[i\]** is expanded automatically) and select **name**, then click **Next**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpe_s9.png)

10.  On the Define Query page, click **Finish**.

    An empty Employees table is displayed.

11.  To make the second Name column descriptive, click the **Data** tab. Under **Table Columns**, click the ![Column Detail icon](./images/vbcscp_columndetail_icon.png) **Column Detail** arrow next to **Name (departmentObject)**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpe_s11.png)

12.  In **Columns, Header Text** field, change `Name` to `Department`, then click ![Back to Table icon](./images/vbcscp_backtotable_icon.png) **Table** to return to the main **Data** tab.

## **STEP 4**: Add a Create Page for the Employee Business Object

1.  Click the **Quick Start** tab, then click **Add Create Page**.
2.  On the Select Endpoint page, select the **Employee** business object, if necessary, and click **Next**.
3.  On the Page Detail page, under Endpoint Structure, select the **hireDate**, **email**, and **department** check boxes (**name** is already selected, because it's a required field).
4.  Change the **Button label** field to `Create`. Leave the other values set to their defaults. Click **Finish**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpc_s4.png)

    A **Create** button appears above the table, and the main-create-employee page appears in the pages list.

5.  In the pages list, click the **main-create-employee** page to open it in the Page Designer.
6.  Click within the form on the page but outside of a component (that is, in the **Form Layout** component on the page). In the **General** tab of the Form Layout's properties, set the **Max Columns** value to **2**. The fields now appear in two columns.
7.  Click **Live** to make the form active. To hide the Properties pane and make more room, click **Properties**. Enter `Leslie Smith` in the **Name** field. Select today's date from the **Hire Date** calendar, and enter `lsmith@example.com` in the **Email** field. Select `Administration` (the only choice) from the **Department** drop-down list. (You can use other data if you wish, except for the department, because you have only one department.) Click **Save**.  

    Oracle Visual Builder briefly displays a message and then places you in the main page flow of your application. As with the departments pages, you can navigate from the main-employees page to the main-create-employee page. There is no connection between the Employee page flow and the Department page flow, however.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpc_s7_result.png)

8.  Return to the main-employees page. (You can double-click the page tile in the page flow, in addition to using other navigation mechanisms.) If necessary, click **Reload page** ![Reload page icon](./images/vbcscp_reload_icon.png) to display the table with the row you created.
9.  Click **Code** to view HTML code for the main-employees page. You can see the code for the heading, the toolbar, and the table within `div` elements. You could edit this code to create a customized user interface. The components and classes all begin with `oj-`, indicating that they are Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET) components.  

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpc_s9.png)

10.  Click **Design** to return to the main-employees page, then click **Structure** to view the page's component structure.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpc_s10.png)

11.  Click **Structure** again to close the structure view.

## **STEP 5**: Change the Name of the main-start Page

It makes sense at this point to change the name of the main-start page to main-departments, to match the name of the main-employees page.

1.  In the Web Apps pane of the Navigator, right-click the **main-start** page and select **Rename**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpn_s1.png)

2.  In the Rename dialog box, replace `start` with `departments` in the **ID** field and click **Rename**. Click the **main** node. The Page Flow page shows the renamed page along with the others.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpn_s2.png)

3.  Double-click **main-departments** to go to that page again.
4.  Although you have changed its name, the main-departments page will continue to be the page where your application starts when you run it. To find out why, click **Source View** ![Source View icon](./images/vbcscp_sourceview_icon.png) in the Navigator and expand the **webApps**, **hrwebapp**, **flows**, and **main** nodes. Then click **main-flow.json**.

    ![](./images/vbcscp_cpn_s4.png)

    You can see that the `defaultPage` property has been set to the value `main-departments`, making it the starting page for the web application flow. (If we'd looked before, it would have been set to `main-start`.)
