# Add Pages for Working with Data

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to use the Quick Starts provided with Oracle Visual Builder to create pages and buttons that allow you to edit data, view details of data, and delete data in a table.

Estimated Lab Time:  15 minutes

### Background

In Oracle Visual Builder, you can use Quick Starts for table components to create specific kinds of pages to create, edit, and delete business object data. The Quick Starts add buttons and action chains that save you the work of creating these elements yourself.

In a previous tutorial, you used a couple of the table quick starts. In this tutorial, you'll use the rest of them.

## **STEP 1**: Add an Edit Page for the Department Business Object

1.  In the HR Application, click the **Web Applications** ![Web Applications icon](./images/vbcsmd_webapp_icon.png) tab, go to the **main-departments** page, then click the **Table** component in the **Page Designer** tab. If necessary, click **Reload page** ![Reload page icon](./images/vbcsmd_refresh_icon.png) to view the departments. Click the **Components** tab to make room to view the page.
2.  In the Table's Properties pane, click the **Quick Start** tab to display the Quick Start menu, then click **Add Edit Page**.

4.  On the Select Update Endpoint page, select the **Department** business object, if necessary, and click **Next**.
5.  On the Page Details page, select **location** under Endpoint Structure (**name** is already selected) and click **Finish**.

    An **Edit Department** button is displayed in the toolbar on the main-departments page. The button is inactive.


## **STEP 2**: Add a Detail Page for the Department Business Object

1.  In the Quick Start menu, click **Add Detail Page**.
2.  On the Select Endpoint page, select the **Department** business object, if necessary, and click **Next**.

    A **Department Detail** button is displayed in the toolbar on the main-departments page. The button is inactive.

4.  Click **Live**, select a row, then click the **Department Detail** button to open the main-department-detail page.
5.  Click **Design** to return to Design view.
