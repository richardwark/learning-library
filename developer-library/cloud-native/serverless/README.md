Gigi's pizza Hands On Labs are a series of labs based on a Demo developed by WeDo Team as part of an innovation initiative to approach Oracle Cloud Solutions by providing practical examples that could be “touched” and easily understood.

Demo is known as Gigi’s Pizza. The Use Case is focused in microservices/serverless (fn) and Multitenant DataBase. We have three microservices coded in different languages like nodejs and of course Java (Helidon framework). This three microservices are part of a delivery pizza app, one microservice controls the orders, other one controls the pizza delivery and the last one controls the accounting. We coded a serverless function to calculate discounts, according to several bussiness rules like credit card type or pizza order total prize.
