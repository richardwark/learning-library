# Oracle Database 19c JSON Documents

**JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is defined in standards ECMA-404 (JSON Data Interchange Format) and ECMA-262 (ECMAScript Language Specification, third edition). The JavaScript dialect of ECMAScript is a general programming language used widely in web browsers and web servers.

**Oracle Database** supports **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** data natively with relational database features, including transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.

## Workshop Requirements
