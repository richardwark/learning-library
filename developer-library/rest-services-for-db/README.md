# RESTful Services for your Autonomous Database

## Introduction
Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) bridges HTTPS and your Oracle Database. A mid-tier Java application, ORDS provides a Database Management REST API, SQL Developer Web, a PL/SQL Gateway, SODA for REST, and the ability to publish RESTful Web Services for interacting with the data and stored procedures in your Oracle Database. 

The Java EE implementation offers increased functionality including a command line based configuration, enhanced security, file caching, and RESTful web services. Oracle REST Data Services also provides increased flexibility by supporting deployments using Oracle WebLogic Server, Apache Tomcat, and a standalone mode. Oracle REST Data Services further simplifies the deployment process because there is no Oracle home required, as connectivity is provided using an embedded JDBC driver.


Watch the video below for a comprehensive overview of REST and how ORDS provides what you need to deliver RESTful Services for your Oracle Database.

### Objectives

-   Enable a user for REST access
-   Publish a RESTful service for a database table
-   Secure your REST endpoints

### Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="\_blank">Oracle Cloud account</a>. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: [Login to Oracle Cloud]()
* Lab: [Provision an Autonomous Database]()


# Developing RESTful Services in Autonomous Database

In this lab you will use the browser-based SQL and REST workshop tools, connect to your Autonomous Database and REST enable a table. You will then secure that REST endpoint all within a single UI.

## **Step 1:**Connect to your Autonomous Database using SQL Developer Web

## **Step 2:**Create a user for Application development

## **Step 3:**Load data into the database

## **Step 4:**Auto-REST enable a table

## **Step 5**: Securing the REST endpoint

## Conclusion
 In this lab, you had an opportunity to get an introduction to REST services.
