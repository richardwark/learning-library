### STEP 1: Access GGBD Image 

          Will update with Live Labs connectivity


### Lab1

Lab 1 – Install GoldenGate binaries for Big Data


PLEASE USE ‘ggadmin’ USER FOR ALL THE LABS (not root)

su – ggadmin

Password = Data1Integration! or oracle

In this lab we will install GoldenGate for Big Data in the GG Target Home. Follow the steps below to install GG, or optionally you can select “I” from the Lab Menu below to auto-install GG.

If already at a Unix prompt, you can access the Lab Menu by typing the alias ‘labmenu’

The following Lab Menu will be displayed, select 1. Review the overview notes on the following screen, then select Q to quit. These online notes have been provided so you can cut/paste file names to another session, to avoid typos.
FYI: LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set for GG, and Java version needs to be version 1.8 or higher. (This is already done in the env script for this workshop)
To install GoldenGate, you will extract the GG binaries tar file – this file has been copied to /u01 as part of the setup. Then connect to the GoldenGate command line interface (ggsci) and run CREATE SUBDIRS to create the subdirectories in the GoldenGate home.

Follow these instructions to install GoldenGate for Big Data

Congratulations, GoldenGate for Big Data is now installed. You can proceed to the next lab, or to any other lab. Each lab can be run independently.

## Optional step (Do not select Auto-install if you already installed GG manually)

If you would like to auto-install GoldenGate for Big Data, you can select this option. To access the Lab Menu, type the alias ‘labmenu’, then select I.

Congratulations, GoldenGate for Big Data is now installed. You can proceed to the next lab, or to any other lab. Each lab can be run independently.


You have completed lab 1! Great Job!
