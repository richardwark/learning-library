## Introduction to Conversational Approach to Your Applications

This workshop walks you through the steps to use **Autonomous Database** and **Application Express (APEX)** to store information, offer a **REST API** with **Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)** and enable you to interact with your customers by keeping a conversation with **Digital Assistant**.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

- Store information in a powerful database 
- Provide a 24/7 conversational experience with people using your services
- Explore Oracle Digital Assistant
- Explore modern and quick APEX development 
- Build secure and powerful REST APIs

## **STEP 1**: Requirements

1. In order to walk through this workshop you need to develop the integration with **REST API**. You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for that.

2. Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. **Node.js** is designed to build scalable network applications.

3. Additionally you need to be familiar with the use of **Command Prompt/Terminal** so we will show you briefly the way to use it for Windows users.

    As a **Windows user** you need to type on the **Windows Search** Icon:

    ```
    <copy>cmd</copy>
    ```

    and select **Command Prompt**.

    That will open the Command Prompt/Terminal so you are ready to go.

    [Here you can find a basic guidance of commands that you can use on the terminal.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands)


## **STEP 2**: Node.js Installation

We are going to **install** Node.js, if you have done this you can skip this step.

[Download Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the official website. It is fine if the version is higher than the one in the screenshot.

1. We are going to install on **Windows** but it works in a similar way in **Linux** and **MacOS**.

    You can go with the default setup for the installation.

2. Final step, click **Install**:

3. Installation **completed**.

4. The last step sometimes take a while on Windows because the lack of libraries, plus sometimes perform a Windows Update. Another reminder to swap to Linux ;) Be patient and carry on.

    ![Node Native Modules Installation](./images/node_native_module.png)

    Check if the installation went **well**. Open a Command Prompt, or Terminal in Linux and MacOS and run the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>node -v</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>npm -v</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>npx @oracle/bots-node-sdk -v</copy>
    ```

    Like this:

At this point, you are ready to start learning!
