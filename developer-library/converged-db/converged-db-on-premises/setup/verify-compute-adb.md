# Verify Compute Instance Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to login to your pre-created compute instance running on Oracle Cloud.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Gather details needed to connect to your instance (Public IP Address)
- Learn how to connect to your compute instance using SSH protocol

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A LiveLabs Cloud account and assigned compartment
- The IP address and instance name for your Compute instance
- Successfully logged into your LiveLabs account
- A Valid SSH Key

## **Step 1:** Gather compute instance details
1. Now that your instance has been provisioned, navigate to ***My Reservations***, find the request you submitted from the list displayed (only one item will be displayed if this is your first request).

2. Click on ***Launch Workshop***

3. In the expanded **Workshop Details**, look for the instance(s) and write down the public IP address(es).

4. Click on **Open workshop instructions in a new tab** to access the workshop guides and get started with labs execution.

## **Step 2:** How to Establish a Terminal Connection to your Instance
Depending on your workshop, you may need to connect to the instance via a secure shell client (SSH). If you're instructed in the next lab(s) to execute tasks via an SSH terminal, review the options below and select the one that best meet your needs.

### **Option 1:** MAC or Windows CYGWIN Emulator
1.  Go to ***Compute >> Instances*** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment)
2.  On the instance homepage, find the Public IP address for your instance.
3.  Open up a terminal (MAC) or cygwin emulator as the opc user.  Enter yes when prompted.

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ````

### **Option 2:** Windows using Putty
On Windows, you can use PuTTY as an SSH client. PuTTY enables Windows users to connect to remote systems over the internet using SSH and Telnet. SSH is supported in PuTTY, provides for a secure shell, and encrypts information before it's transferred.

1.  Download and install PuTTY. [http://www.putty.org](http://www.putty.org)
2.  Run the PuTTY program. On your computer, go to **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**
3.  Select or enter the following information:
    - Category: _Session_
    - IP address: _Your service instance’s public IP address_
    - Port: _22_
    - Connection type: _SSH_

#### **Configuring Automatic Login**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Connection and then **Select** Data.

2.  Enter your auto-login username. Enter **opc**.

#### **Adding Your Private Key**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Auth.
2.  **Click** browse and find the private key file that matches your VM’s public key. This private key should have a .ppk extension for PuTTy to work.

#### **To save all your settings:**

1.  In the category section, **Click** session.
2.  In the saved sessions section, name your session, for example ( EM13C-ABC ) and **Click** Save.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).

## Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips

If you encountered any issues during the lab, follow the steps below to resolve them.  If you are unable to resolve, please skip to the **Need Help** section to submit your issue via our  support forum.

### Issue 1: Can't login to instance
Participant is unable to login to instance

#### Tips for fixing Issue #1
There may be several reasons why you can't login to the instance.  Here are some common ones we've seen from workshop participants
- Incorrectly formatted ssh key (see above for fix)
- User chose to login from MAC Terminal, Putty, etc and the instance is being blocked by company VPN (shut down VPNs and try to access or use Cloud Shell)
- Incorrect name supplied for ssh key (Do not use sshkeyname, use the key name you provided)
- @ placed before opc user (Remove @ sign and login using the format above)
- Make sure you are the oracle user (type the command *whoami* to check, if not type *sudo su - oracle* to switch to the oracle user)
- Make sure the instance is running (type the command *ps -ef | grep oracle* to see if the oracle processes are running)
