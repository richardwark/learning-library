### About Oracle ORDS

ORDS is middle tier JAVA application that allows you to access your Oracle Database resources via REST. Use standard HTTP calls (GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|HEAD) via URIs that ORDS makes available (/ords/database123/user3/module5/something/)


ORDS will find and run the appropriate database workload (a query, an anonymous block), and return the output as formatted JSON.

**Install ORDS using SQL Developer**

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) is bundled with SQL Developer. You can use SQL Developer to install the ORDS version that is bundled in SQL Developer or a standalone version.

As part of this lab , ORDS is pre-installed and ready for use.

About RESTful Services 

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. A service is described as RESTful when it conforms to the tenets of REST.  RESTful Service has the following characteristics: 

•	Data is modeled as a set of resources. Resources are identified by URIs. 

•	A small, uniform set of operations are used to manipulate resources (for example, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

•	A resource can have multiple representations (for example, a blog might have a HTML representation and a RSS representation). 

•	Services are stateless and since it is likely that the client will want to access related resources, these should be identified in the representation returned, typically by providing hypertext links. 


**RESTful Services Terminology** 

Common terms that are used throughout this lab: 

- **RESTful Service** : An HTTP web service that conforms to the tenets of the RESTful Architectural Style, as described in "About RESTful Services" above. 

- **Resource Module** : An organizational unit that is used to group related Resource Templates together. 

- **Resource Template** : An individual RESTful ervice that is able to service requests for some set of URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers). The set of URIs is defined by the URI Template of the Resource Template.

- **Route Patterns**: A simple grammar that defines the particular patterns of URIs that a given Resource Template can handle. For example, the pattern, employees/, will match any URI whose path begins with employees/. 

Example: http://localhost:8888/ords/hr/demo/employees/ 

- **Resource Handler** : Provides the logic required to service a particular HTTP method, for a specific Resource Template. For example the logic of the GET HTTP method for the above Resource Template might be:

select empno, ename, dept from emp where empno = :id

**HTTP Operation**: HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) defines a number of standard methods that can be performed on resources:

-	**GET** : Retrieve the resource contents. 
-	**POST** : Store a new resource.
-	**PUT** : Update an existing resource. 
-	**DELETE** : Remove a resource. 

## Step-1: Start ORDS in standalone mode

1. To start ORDS in standalone mode, go to 
   
   ````
   Tools-> Rest Data Services->Run
   ````

2. Select ORDS file as –"/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/db_1/ords/ords.war"
  
3.	Then provide ORDS config file location as – “/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/db_1/ords/config”

## Step 2: AutoREST Enable a Schema and its JSON Table

To enable AutoREST on a schema and a table, perform the following steps:
       
1. On the left-side, the Connections navigator is displayed. To make a new connection, click down arrow beside + sign and click New Connection
  
  ![](./images/ordsl1.png " ") 

2.	Enter **JSON** for **Connection Name, appjson** for **Username, Oracle_4U**for **Password** , 
&lt;**Instance _ip_address**&gt; for **Hostname**. Enter **JXLPDB** for **Service name** and **1521** for **Port**. Click **Test** to test the connection.

![](./images/ordsl2.png " ") 

3.	Once the connection test shows Status:success, click **connect** to create the connection.

4.	On the Connections navigator, connect to **appjson** schema by expanding it. Right click **JSON** and select **REST Services> Enable REST Services.**

![](./images/ordsl3.png " ") 

5.	The RESTful Services Wizard will appear. Enter the following and click **Next**.

![](./images/ordsl4.png " ") 


![](./images/ordsl5.png " ") 

6.	The RESTful Summary will appear. Click **Finish**.

![](./images/ordsl6.png " ") 

7.	The SQL is processed and success message appears. Click **OK**.

![](./images/ordsl7.png " ") 

8.	Now, to AutoREST Enable a table, expand Tables (Filtered) under JSON by clicking + beside it. Right click **PURCHASE_ORDER** and select **Enable REST Service.**

![](./images/ordsl8.png " ") 

9.	The RESTful Services Wizard will appear. Enter the following and click **Next**.

![](./images/ordsl9.png " ") 

![](./images/ordsl10.png " ") 

10.	This screen gives a summary of the selected operations. Click the SQL tab.

![](./images/ordsl11.png " ") 

11.	Here is the SQL to REST Enable the table. Click **Finish**.

![](./images/ordsl12.png " ") 

12.	The SQL is processed. Click **OK**.

![](./images/ordsl13.png " ") 

The **appjson** schema and the **Purchase_order** table are now REST enabled.

13.	Retrieve Purchase_order table data.  Open the browser and enter the following URL in the address bar: 

````
http://<instance_IP_address>:9090/ords/JXLPDB/appjson/purchase_order/
````
The URL corresponds to the following:

````
http://<HOST>:<PORT>/ords/<PDBNAME>/<SchemaAlias>/table/ 
````

![](./images/ordsl14.png " ") 

14. Define Resource Module, Resource Template

Perform the following steps to create your first RESTful Service

15. Expand Rest Data Services and right click **Modules** and select **New Module.**

![](./images/ordsl15.png " ") 

16. **The RESTful Services Wizard** appears which will assist you to define a resource module and a resource template. Enter the following values in the wizard and click **Next**.

  ````
  <copy>

Module Name: cnvg 	
URI Prefix: cnvg/ 	
Publish- Make this RESful Service available for use: (check) 
Pagination Size : 25 
Origins Allowed: (leave blank)

   
    </copy>
 ````

![](./images/ordsl16.png " ") 

17. The RESTful Services Wizard - Step 2 of 3 displays the Resource Template attributes. Enter the following values in the wizard.
 
 ````
    <copy>

URI Pattern: cnvg/:id 	
Priority : Low 
ETag : Secure Hash
    
    </copy>
 ````

![](./images/ordsl17.png " ") 

The resource template groups the resource handlers that consist of the HTTP operation method: GET, DELETE, POST and PUT. Only one resource handler per HTTP operation method type is allowed. For example, you cannot have two HTTP GET resource handlers for the same resource template. But you can have one GET and one PUT resource handlers.

18. The RESTful Services Wizard - Step 3 of 3 displays the RESTful Summary. Review the summary and click Finish to create your resource module and resource template.
  
![](./images/ordsl18.png " ") 

URI pattern cnvg/:id in the above template will retrieve the information based on the parameter id. To retrieve full table data, we will create another template with URI patter as cnvg/ in the next step.

19.  Right click on module cnvg and click on add template.

![](./images/ordsl19.png " ") 

20. Provide the URI patter as cnvg/ and click on **Next**
