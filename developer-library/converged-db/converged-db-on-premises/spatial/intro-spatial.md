# Workshop Introduction and Overview

## Introduction to Oracle SPATIAL 

Oracle Spatial is an integrated set of functions, procedures, data types, and data models that support spatial analytics. The spatial features enable spatial data to be stored, accessed, and analyzed quickly and efficiently in an Oracle database.

Oracle Spatial is designed to make spatial data management easier and more natural to users of location-enabled applications and geographic information system (GIS) applications. Once spatial data is stored in an Oracle database, it can be easily manipulated, retrieved, and related to all other data stored in the database.

A common example of spatial data can be seen in a road map. A road map is a two-dimensional object that contains points, lines, and polygons that can represent cities, roads, and political boundaries such as states or provinces. A road map is a visualization of geographic information. 

The data that indicates the Earth location (such as longitude and latitude) of these rendered objects is the spatial data. When the map is rendered, this spatial data is used to project the locations of the objects on a two-dimensional piece of paper.

Oracle Spatial consists of the following: 

-	Schema (MDSYS)
-	A spatial indexing mechanism  	
-	Operators, functions, and procedures
-	Native data type for vector data called SDO\_GEOMETRY(An Oracle table can contain one or more SDO\_GEOMETRY columns.)


Scenario
MyCompany has several major warehouses. It needs to locate its customers who are near a given warehouse, to inform them of new advertising promotions. To locate its customers and perform location-based analysis, MyCompany must store location data for both its customers and warehouses.

We will be using three tables – CUSTOMERS, WAREHOUSES and WAREHOUSES\_DTP.

Each table stores location using Oracle's native spatial data type, SDO\_GEOMETRY. A location can be stored as a point in an SDO\_GEOMETRY column of a table. The customer's location is associated with longitude and latitude values on the Earth's surface—for example, -63.13631, 52.485426.
