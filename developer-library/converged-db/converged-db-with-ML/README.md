# Oracle's Converged Database
The Oracle Database converges support for multiple data models and workloads into a single database, while supporting popular development tools and techniques like events and REST interfaces. As opposed to using multiple single purpose databases for each data type, using a converged database results in a unified data tier, enabling real-time analytics and machine learning on production data.
