# Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to JavaScript for APEX Developers hands-on lab. 

## Developing on APEX

For developers that know SQL and PL/SQL, no other framework is as empowering as Oracle Application Express (APEX). But at the end of the day, APEX creates web apps, and it's JavaScript that programs the web. Over the years, JavaScript's role in APEX apps has increased, both for the creators of APEX and the developers using it - a trend that will continue in the years to come.

APEX developers only need to know a little bit of JavaScript to have a significant impact, and that's what this hands-on lab is all about! You'll start by learning some of the basics of JavaScript, then learn how to add JavaScript to APEX apps, and finally, you will learn to use jQuery to work with the DOM.
