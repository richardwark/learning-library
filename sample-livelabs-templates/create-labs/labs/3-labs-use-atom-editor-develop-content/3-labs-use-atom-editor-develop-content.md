# Use Atom Editor to Develop Markdown Content

## Introduction

You can use your preferred editor to author and edit your Markdown (.md) content for rendering the Workshop output.

**Note:** Oracle recommends the UA Developers to use Atom.

### Objectives

* Learn about the tools that are available to develop and host your content.
* Learn how to merge content.
* Create workshop and lab content.
* Preview the content in a browser.


### What Do You Need?
* An IDE, such as Atom.
* A local web server such as **atom-live-server**, a plugin for `Atom.io`.

## **STEP 1:** Install Atom
`Atom.io` is a 3rd party IDE freely available under MIT License.

To install Atom:
1. Go to the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.51.0) URL.
2. Click the zip file  for your operating system, save and extract the zip file.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-download.png " ")
3. From the extracted files, click `atom.exe` to launch Atom.

## **STEP 2:** Install the atom-live-server Plugin
You must NOT be connected to Oracle's network or VPN while installing the **atom-live-server** package.

To install **atom-live-server**:
1. In the **Atom** editor, click **Help**, and then select **Welcome Guide**.
2. In the **Welcome Guide** screen, click **Install a Package**, and then click **Open Installer** to display the **Install Packages** window.

3. Enter **atom-live-server**, and then click **Install**.

  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-install-package-atom-live-server.png " ")

4. When the installation is successfully completed, the **Install** button is replaced with the **Uninstall** and **Disable** buttons.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-uninstall-disable.png " ")
The **atom-live-server** plugin is added to the **Packages** menu.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-atom-live-server-package-menu.png " ")

## **STEP 3:** Merge Content from Git Before you Start Editing your Content
  Everyday before you start editing your content, ensure to do a Merge in **GitHub Desktop**.
  Merging synchronizes the content in your cloned repository with the latest content on the **upstream/master** repository and ensures that you have the most recent versions of the templates and other workshops/labs.

  To merge content:
  1. Start your **GitHub Desktop** client.
  2. Select **Branch > Merge into current branch** to display the **Merge in Master** window.

    ![](./images/git-hub-merge-current-branch.png " ")

  3. Under the **Default branch**, the master branch is selected by default. This indicates the local clone on your PC.
    ![](./images/git-hub-merge-local-clone-default-branch.png " ")

  4. Scroll down the **Merge into master** window, select **upstream/master** (this is your master repository which is the learning-library), and then click **Merge upstream/master into master**. In this example, this will merge 120 commits by other people from the **upstream/master** into the clone on the local PC.

    ![](./images/git-hub-merge-upstream-master.png " ")

  5. When the merge is successfully completed, a **"Successfully merged upstream/master into master"** message is displayed. To push the new commits from the local clone to your forked location, click **Push origin**.

    **Note**: To determine if your clone is up-to-date with **upstream/master** (production), repeat Steps 2 to 4. If both repositories are synchronized, then the following message is displayed: "This branch is up to date with **upstream/master**".

    ![](./images/git-hub-merge-branch-up-to-date.png " ")

  In the **GitHub Desktop** UI, notice that the **Push Origin** is replaced by **Fetch Origin** after the push origin operation is successfully completed.  The local clone and fork repositories are now synchronized with the master repository.

  ![](./images/git-hub-merge-fetch-origin.png " ")

## **STEP 4:** Create your Labs and Workshop Content
Leverage the content from the **learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop** folder to start creating lab and workshop content for your project.

*For screen shots of OCI menu navigation, use the images with absolute links in **Lab 1: Provision an Instance** markdown from the sample-workshop. A preview of the images can be found **[here](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/sample-livelabs-templates/sample-workshop/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=provision)** under STEP 0.*

**Note**: Ensure to update your clone from the **upstream/master** repository (detailed in **STEP 2**) on a regular basis whenever we are working on the markdown files.

To create your lab and workshop content:
1. Submit your workshop to the [LiveLabs Workshop Management System](http://bit.ly/oraclelivelabs) BEFORE you begin development.  No github requests will be approved without an approved LWMS ID.
2. Open your cloned repository using Windows Explorer.
3. Create your project folder anywhere in your cloned repository. If a folder already exists  for the product you work on, then you can create your project folder within that.
4. Go to **learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop**. This has a few lab folders, such as **analyze**, **query** etc. Every lab folder contains the following: a **files** folder, an **images** folder, and the respective `.md` file.
5. Copy any lab folder, such as the **query** folder to your project folder. In your project folder, rename the folder **query** and the respective `.md` file within it as per your requirement.  Based on the sample **query** folder, you can create and rename as many labs (folders) and the respective `.md` files as per your requirement.

  **Note**: The **files** folder within every sample lab folder is currently not required and is reserved for future use.
  ![](./images/lab-files-folder-currently-not-nedded.png " ")
  After you copy the sample folder to your project folder, you can delete your copy of the **files** folder from your project folder.
  Your lab will look similar to this example:
  ![](./images/lab-folder-structure.png " ")

5. Similarly, copy the **workshops** folder along with its contents from **learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop** to your project folder. For example, **GitHub\learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\create-labs\labs**.
6. To edit the `.md` file of your lab, open **Atom** Editor, click **File > Open Folder** to display the **Open Folder** dialog box.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-open-folder.png " ")
7. Navigate to **GitHub\learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\create-labs\labs** and click **Select Folder** to open your project folder.
  ![](./images/atom-editor-browse-select-lab.png " ")
  The project folder along with the labs and **workshops** folder is displayed in **Atom** Editor.
    ![](./images/atom-editor-project-folder-displayed.png " ")

8. Select the `.md` file you want to edit, for example, select the `1-labs-git-hub-get-started-install-configure.md` file and edit your lab content. Similarly, edit the `.md` files of the rest of your labs.
    ![](./images/atom-editor-browse-open-mdfile-editing.png " ")
9. If you want to add images in your lab, then include them within the **images** folder. You can insert images in the respective `.md` file.
10. Similarly to edit your workshop content, expand the **workshops\freetier** folder in **Atom**, edit the `manifest.json` to list the labs you have added to your workshop (or plan to add) and update the title of the workshop. The `manifest.json` is like your book map file in SDL.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-manifest-json.png " ")
11. If you want to add an introduction to your workshop, then navigate to **learning-library\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop\introduction** and copy the `introduction.md` file to your **workshops\freetier** folder, for example: **GitHub\learning-library\create-labs\labs\workshops\freetier**. You can rename it if you would want to. In this example, we have renamed it to `intro.md`. Update the `intro.md` as per your requirements. Similarly, you can create a `README.md` file with the same `introduction.md` file and update the `README.md` with a summary of your workshop. Note that the `intro.md` and `README.md` files are optional files for your workshop's introduction. The workshop introduction can be treated as another lab.
    ![](./images/use-atom-editor-readme-update.png " ")

    In this example, your project folder **labs** contains 5 labs and a workshop. Your **workshops\freetier** folder can be treated as another lab that includes an introduction to your workshop.
    ![](./images/use-atom-editor-folder-structure-in-atom.png " ")

## **STEP 5:** Preview Your Workshop and Labs Using atom-live-server

  To preview your output in a browser:
1. Start the **atom-live-server**. In the Atom editor, select **Packages > atom-live-server > Start server**.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-packages-start-live-server.png " ")

  By default, the **atom-live-server** opens a browser window that displays the folders inside your project (**labs**) folder.
2. Click the **workshops** folder and then click **freetier** folder that contains the workshop you want to view.
  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-open-live-server.png " ")

  The Workshop is displayed along with the labs. You can make content changes in the **Atom** editor to the workshop and lab files, save the changes, and the updated content gets automatically refreshed in the browser window.

  ![](./images/use-atom-editor-workshop-output.png " ")

3. To stop the **atom-live-server**, go back to **Atom**, select  **Packages > atom-live-server > Stop folder-path-at-port-#**.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
