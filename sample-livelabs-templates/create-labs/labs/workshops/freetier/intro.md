## What are Labs and Workshops?
A lab is a new model adopted by the DB organization to enhance the tutorial experience. Labs are what the User Assistance community commonly knew as Oracle by example (OBE). Labs can be combined to form a workshop, formerly known as Hands-on Lab or HOL, or a Learning Path.

An individual Markdown (.md) file is called a lab.
A collection of labs is called a workshop.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based version control system designed for software developers.
  * At the core of GitHub is Git, an open source version control system that manages file versions and tracks the changes made by the members of a repository.
  * The Hub is a cloud-based repository that manages storage of the files and provides a folder structure.

## GitHub Projects and Repositories
* GitHub is organized by projects.
* Each project has its own repository (commonly referred to as repo) that is accessed
through a unique URL.

## Oracle GitHub Project and learning-library Repository

  **Note**: The term "learning-library" is NOT the same as Oracle Learning Library (OLL) used formerly in the OBE world. The Oracle Learning Library (OLL) is an online resource for content about Oracle products [https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1), whereas "learning-library" is the GitHub repository that is accessed through a unique URL: [https://github.com/oracle/learning-library](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library).

## GitHub Workflow
The following flow chart shows the process that your need to follow to set up the environment for developing labs and workshops:

## Workshop Objectives
  * Set up the GitHub environment.
  * Install and use GitHub Desktop Client.
  * Fork the learning-library repository (copy repository content to GitHub).
  * Clone your forked learning-library repository (copy repository content to local machine).
  * Understand the lab folders' structure.
  * Install and use Atom Editor to and the Markdown templates to develop content.
  * Perform GitHub operations to commit your developed content to the master (production) learning-library on GitHub.
  * Host workshops and labs in LiveLabs and optionally in OHC (User Assistance only).


## Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Get Started with Git and Set up the Environment
- **Lab 2:** Understand the Folder Structure
- **Lab 3:** Use Atom Editor and Live Server to Develop Content
- **Lab 4:** Use GitHub to Commit to Git Repository (Git Web UI)
- **Lab 5:** Add GitHub Hosted Labs to OHC

## What's Next
