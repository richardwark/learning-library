# Understand the learning-library Folder Structure

## Introduction
This lab describes the prescribed folder structure that we need follow for developing labs and workshops.
### Objectives
* Understand the learning-library folder structure.
* Get to know the components of the workshop and the lab folders.

## **STEP 1:** Folder Structure of the learning-library Repository

The following image shows a folder structure of the "Getting Started with Oracle Big Data Service" workshop that is opened in the **Atom** Editor, through the project folder **bds**. You can see this structure at the following URL [https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/data-management-library/big-data/bds](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/tree/master/data-management-library/big-data/bds), or in the **data-management-library/big-data/bds** folder of the clone on your machine.

## **STEP 2:** Understand the Components of the Workshop and Lab Folders
  The following describes the components of the above example:
  * The root folder of this example is the name of the project, **bds**.

      **Note:** You can create your project folder anywhere within your cloned repository. For example, the **bds** project folder is created in the **\learning-library\data-management-library\big-data**.
  * Each lab has a separate folder, for example, **bds-access-utility-node**, **bds-create-hadoop-user** etc, containing respective `.md` files.
  * Each lab folder has an **images** folder that contains the screenshots that are used in the lab.
  * The **workshops** is the workshop folder, which contains the **freetier** folder that in turn contains the following:  `index.html`, `intro.md`, `manifest.json`, and `README.md` files.
  * The `index.html` file is executed when it is accessed by a browser.
  * The `manifest.json` file defines the structure of the workshop that the `index.html` file renders.
  * The `intro.md` file contains the introduction of the workshop.
  * The `README.md` file contains the summary of the entire Workshop. You can view it from your git repository.
    Both the `intro.md` and `README.md` files are optional files in your **workshops/freetier** folder. You can treat your **workshops/freetier** folder as another lab by including an introduction to your workshop in the `intro.md`. A key difference between the **workshops/freetier** folder and the other lab folders is that the **workshops/freetier** contains the `index.html`, without which, you cannot view (nor preview) your LiveLabs in a browser.
    The following screen shows a sample `manifest.json` file that is opened in the **Atom** Editor.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
