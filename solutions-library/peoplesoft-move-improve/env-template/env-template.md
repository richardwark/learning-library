# Creating New Environment Template

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a new environment template from the previously downloaded PeopleSoft Image

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
The purpose of this lab is to show you how to create a new environment template from a downloaded PeopleSoft Image in order to create a new PeopleSoft Environment.

In this lab, you will:
* Create a new environment template

Let's take a look at the Network Topology again, so we can understand what we are configuring.

We have already provisioned Cloud Manager in a private subnet and the Jump Host in a public Subnet. We are now working towards provisioning our PeopleSoft Environment in Availability Domain-3. 

*Note:* The reason we have separated it out into 3 ADs for this workshop is because of compute Service Limit constraints in a trial environment. For production environment, it is suggested to have all the tiers of Peoplesoft in one Availability Domain, maintaining High Availability through Fault Domain.

### Prerequisites
- A PeopleSoft Cloud Manager Instance
- A downloaded PeopleSoft Image

## **STEP 1**: Creating a New Environment Template

Navigate to Cloud Manager Dashboard -> **Environment Template**.  
  Click **Add New Template** button.

1. On the General Details page, provide the values below: 
    * Give your environment a unique **Name** such as **TestWorkshop** 
    * For **Description**, we'll use **Workshop Test environment**
    * Click on the **Search Icon**. Do NOT type anything. If your DPK was downloaded properly, it should appear in the Search Results. If you can't see it yet, please wait and refresh the page after awhile. Since we subscribed to the HCM channel in the previous lab, we see **PEOPLESOFT HCM UPDATE IMAGE 9.2.037 - NATIVE OS** (see 2nd screenshot below).
