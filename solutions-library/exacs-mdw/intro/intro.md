# Introduction

## About this Workshop

An Exadata Cloud Service DB system consists of a quarter rack, half rack, or full rack of compute nodes and storage servers, tied together by a high-speed, low-latency Infiniband network and intelligent Exadata software. You can configure automatic backups, optimize for different workloads, and scale up the system to meet increased demands.

The compute nodes are each configured with a virtual machine (VM). You have root privilege for the compute node VMs, so you can load and run additional software on them. However, you do not have administrative access to the Exadata infrastructure components, such as the physical compute node hardware, network switches, power distribution units (PDUs), integrated lights-out management (ILOM) interfaces, or the Exadata Storage Servers, which are all administered by Oracle.

You have full administrative privileges for your databases, and you can connect to your databases by using Oracle Net Services from outside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You are responsible for database administration tasks such as creating tablespaces and managing database users. You can also customize the default automated maintenance setup, including backups, and you have full control of the recovery process in the event of a database failure.

These hands-on lab guides provide step-by-step directions to setting up and using your Exadata Cloud Service platform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Estimated Workshop Time: 225 minutes / 3 hours 45 minutes.

## What is Exadata Cloud Service?

* Exadata Cloud Service is offered on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, within OCI regions.
* Exadata Cloud Service available in quarter Rack, Half Rack or full Rack configurations.
* Exadata rack in OCI includes DB nodes, storage nodes and Infiniband switches.
* The storage and compute nodes are connected via high bandwidth Infiniband network that provides RDMA based storage access to the compute nodes.
* Exadata storage software runs on storage servers and offloads database SQL processing
overheads.
* Currently, a single VM per compute node is supported. It allows root access for customers while protecting hardware and network, DB nodes are virtualized using Xen based OVM.
* Oracle Manages storage cells, switches, management or IB network while customer manages database compute nodes.
* Exadata Cloud Service provides a control Plane, a Web-based self-service management interface for Exadata cloud service provisioning and interactive access to service administration function

### Objectives

1. Prepare your private network in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
2. Provision Exadata Cloud Service Infrastructure in a private OCI network
3. Provision databases on your Exadata Cloud Service Infrastructure
4. Configure a development system for use with your Exadata Cloud Service database
5. Data Safe with Exadata Cloud Service
6. Real time migration of database using Oracle Goldengate Replication
7. Connect Oracle Analytics Cloud to your Exadata database

You may proceed to the next lab.
