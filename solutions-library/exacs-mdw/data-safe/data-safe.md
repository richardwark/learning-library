# Data Safe with ExaCS

## Introduction

Data Safe is a unified control center for your Oracle Databases which helps you understand the sensitivity of your data, evaluate risks to data, mask sensitive data, implement and monitor security controls, assess user security, monitor user activity, and address data security compliance requirements. Whether youâ€™re using Oracle Autonomous Database or Oracle Database Cloud Service (Exadata, Virtual Machine, or Bare Metal), Data Safe delivers essential data security capabilities as a service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Data Safe helps ensure that your databases are securely configured with the ability to create and customize security baselines for identification of configuration risks. This allows you to not only review and mitigate database risks, but also assess user risks through highlighting critical roles, users, and privileges in your environment. In terms of the users, Data Safe can also allow you to configure audit policies to collect user activity. This can help identify unusual user behavior and understand which users present the highest risk. Alerts can also be configured on risky actions when tracking user activity, complementing the many out-of-the-box audit reports that the product provides.

Data Safe can help you discover the location of sensitive data across all schemas and tables in your database, allowing the user to also add their own custom sensitive type if desired. With Data Safe's data masking capabilities, you can remove risk from non-production data sets, decreasing the likelihood of data breaches by protecting the data from non-authorized users. With over 50 pre-defined masking formats, you can customize your data masking formats and create masking reports to allow teams to operate with reduced risk.

This lab is intended to give you an idea of the capabilities within Oracle Data Safe at a high level.
