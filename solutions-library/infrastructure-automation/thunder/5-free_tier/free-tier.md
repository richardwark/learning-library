# Always Free Resources

## Introduction
In this example, only always free resources are created:
* 1 Compute Instance (having a Micro shape)
* 1 Autonomous Transaction Processing DB
* 1 Standard Bucket (you can get 20GB of objects in it)
* 1 Compartment
* 1 User
* 1 Group
* 1 Policy
* 1 VCN with 1 subnet
* 1 Load balancer having one backend set, one listener and one backend

Don't forget to populate the provider with the details of your tenancy as specified in the prerequisites lab.

## Running the code
In order to be able to spin up the always free resources, you will have to navigate to **thunder -> examples -> free_tier**.

From the free tier folder you can run the following commands:
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars_file

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars_file
```
