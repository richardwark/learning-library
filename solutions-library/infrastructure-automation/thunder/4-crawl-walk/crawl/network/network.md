# Network Examples

## Introduction
Apart from IAM, one thing you will need in order to create your resources is a network.
This example aims to help with creating an independent network with the majority of the components available in OCI.

## Description

The Network module is able to create vcns, subnets, internet gateways, nat gateways, security lists and network security groups, local peering gateways, dynamic routing gateways.

## Dependencies
Apart from the **provider.auto.tfvars**, there may be some other dependencies in the **terraform.tfvars** file that you will have to address.
All the dependencies from this section should have resources that already exist in OCI.

### Compartment Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **compartment\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the compartments that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq"
}
```

## Example
In the provided example, the following resources are created: 
* 2 VCNS
  * hurricane 1
    * One Internet Gateway
    * One Nat Gateway
    * 2 Route tables (one with igw rule, the other with ngw rule)
    * One Security List
    * One NSG with INGRESS rules
    * 2 Subnets (one public, one private)

  * hurricane 2
    * One Internet Gateway
    * One Nat Gateway
    * 2 Route tables (one with igw rule, the other with ngw rule)
    * One Security List
    * One NSG with EGRESS rules
    * 2 Subnets (one public, one private)


In the example from below, there is a list of compartments containing 1 element. By setting in vcn_params `compartment_name` to sandbox, the network will be created in the first element of the list: `ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq`.
All variables can be extended in order to satisfy your needs.


The example is based on **terraform.tfvars** values.
Below there is a small part of the **terraform.tfvars** file, in order to be able to understand the linking between the resources.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq"
}

vcn_params = {
  hur1 = {
    compartment_name  = "sandbox"
    display_name      = "hur1"
    vcn_cidr          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    dns_label         = "hur1"
  }
  hur2 = {
    compartment_name  = "sandbox"
    display_name      = "hur2"
    vcn_cidr          = "11.0.0.0/16"
    dns_label         = "hur2"
  }
}
```

This is just an example, but the number of the resources can be increased/decreased to suit any needs.
For example if you want to increase the number of subnets instances to 3 in the first VCN, you will have to modify the **subnet_params** variable in the terraform.tfvars file.

Don't forget to populate the provider with the details of your tenancy as specified in the main README.md file.

## Running the code

Go to **thunder/examples/crawl/network**
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars
```
