# Compute Examples

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute offers significant price-performance and control improvements compared to on-premise data centers, while providing the elasticity and cost savings of the public cloud. Oracle has a longstanding reputation for providing technologies that empower enterprises to solve demanding business problemsâ€”and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the first cloud that's purpose-built to enable enterprises to run business-critical production workloads.


## Description

The Compute module is able to create linux and windows instances with block volumes attached

- Linux instances parameters
    - ad - ad of the instance
    - shape - The shape of the instance
    - hostname - The instance hostname
    - boot\_volume\_size - The size of the boot volume in GBs
    - preserve\_boot\_volume - Whether to preserve or not the boot volume

## Dependencies
Apart from the **provider.auto.tfvars**, there may be some other dependencies in the **terraform.tfvars** file that you will have to address.
All the dependencies from this section should have resources that already exist in OCI.

### Compartment Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **compartment\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the compartments that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq"
}
```

### Subnet Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **subnet\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the subnets that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
subnet_ids = {
  hur1pub  = "ocid1.subnet.oc1.eu-zurich-1.aaaaaaaapejshjhsljycynokehdhw47oh4vhp2rlakzudnlp5by6gsg6jzfa"
  hur1priv = "ocid1.subnet.oc1.eu-zurich-1.aaaaaaaamcf3qooqlrsoycjkegvqlet2gt3hbrsnurxjj2wezmjs3jhzke6q"
}
```

### NSG Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **nsgs**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the nsgs that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
nsgs = {
  "hurricane1" = "ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.eu-zurich-1.aaaaaaaa7el3mcar2cyw27saug57twlgnf4yxkrfpr55mtz2giufe64cmv2a"
  "hurricane2" = "ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.eu-zurich-1.aaaaaaaallx6bipfe53xr5si5ytdcd6lmgkvlzpytltznosyc2bfbgbegwwq"
}
```

## Example

In the provided example, the following resources are created:

- 2 Linux Instances
    - One has 6 block volumes attached
    - The other one has 1 block volume attached

- 2 Windows Instances
    - One with 3 block volumes attached
    - The other one with 2 block volumes attached

In the example from below, there is a list of compartments containing 1 elements and a list of subnets containing 2 elements. By setting in compute\_params `compartment_name` to sandbox, the instances will be created in the sandbox compartmanet `ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq`. The same thing is happening to the subnet_ids and nsgs. All lists can be extended in order to satisfy your needs.

This is just an example, but the number of the resources can be increased/decreased to suit any needs by adding another map in the specific resource type.

Don't forget to populate the provider with the details of your tenancy as specified in the main README.md file.

## Running the code

Go to **thunder/examples/crawl/compute**
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars
```
