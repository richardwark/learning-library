# Migrating on-premises workload to OCVS

## Introduction

In this lab, we will import the on-premises VMWare environment that we had exported in Lab 2 to OCVS. 

## Objectives
1. Import an ovf file and access the environment as part of the Oracle Cloud VMWare Service.

## Prerequisites
1. Access to the object storage bucket used to store the exported workload in Lab 2.
2. The deployed OCVS environment from Lab 1.

## **Step 1:** Import the osCommerce OVF into Oracle Cloud VMware Service

1. Use the RDP client to connect to the bastion host. Using the pre-authenticated request URL from Lab 2, download the zipped ovf file. Unzip to extract the 3 ovf files on your computer.

8. Once the import OVF and deploy OVF tasks are complete, you can power on the VM. Select the VM that you just imported and power it on by clicking on **Actions**, then selecting **Power On** under the Power sub-menu. Again, the status of the operation can be monitored from the **Recent Tasks** tab.
