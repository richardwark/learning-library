# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop covers the basics needed to create and provision a Siebel Environment using OCI.

After completing this workshop you should have a better understanding of OCI as well as the ability to create and access a Siebel environment that you created as well as view all of the components that were created during the lab to make that possible. After the completion of the lab you will teardown, or destroy, all created components.

Estimated Lab Time: 1 hour and 45 minutes

Notes:

* The workshop is quite detailed and technical. PLEASE take your time and DO NOT skip any steps.
* IP addresses and URLs in the screenshots in this workbook may differ from what you use in the labs as these are dynamically generated.
* For security purposes, some sensitive text (such as IP addresses) may be redacted in the screenshots in this workbook.

UNIX commands (usually executed in an SSH session using PuTTY) are displayed in a monospace font within a box, as follows:

```
$ sudo yum install wget -y $ wget -O bitnami-mean-linux-installer.run https://bitnami.com/stack/mean/download_latest/linux-x64
```

### Workshop Overview

This workshop uses the following components:

* Trial accounts (one per attendee)

  - Virtual Cloud Network and related resources
    - User-generated using Resource Manager and provided Terraform script

  - Oracle Siebel instance
    - User-provisioned using Oracle Marketplace image

  - Siebel Application
    - User deployed through Jenkins

  - Siebel CRM Application


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create a Sub-Compartment
* Create Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
* Provison a Siebel Marketplace image
* Establish Security List Rules for Siebel Instance
* Use Jenkins to deploy an instance of Siebel
* Access Siebel CRM application
* TErminate and teardown all of the resources that you have created

### Prerequisites

You will need the following in order to complete this workshop:

* A modern browser
* A secure remote login (Secure Shell, or SSH) utility
        - Such as PuTTY - downloaded from [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/download)
* Knowledge of basic UNIX commands and the ability to copy and use them

## Appendix
### Terminology

The following terms are commonly employed in Oracle E-Business Suite cloud operations and used throughout our documentation:

**Availability Domain** – One or more data centers located within a region.

**Bucket** – A logical container used by Object Storage for storing your data and files. A bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects.

**Compartments** – Allows you to organize and control access to your cloud resources. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as instances, virtual cloud networks, block volumes) that can be accessed only by certain groups.

**Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Backup Module** – The Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Backup Module is a stand-alone tool that interviews the user to establish settings, and then uses those settings to back up an Oracle E-Business Suite environment to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage.

**Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager** - Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager is a graphical user interface used for creating, managing, and configuring Oracle E-Business Suite environments on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager can be used with the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Backup Module to lift and shift or clone environments from on-premises to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**EBS Cloud Manager infrastructure** – Virtual network resources, compute resources, and policies required to run EBS Cloud Manager on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**EBS Sandbox Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** – Networking and compute resources required to run EBS on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The EBS Sandbox VCN includes the recommended networking resources (VCN, subnets routing tables, internet gateway, security lists, and security rules) to run Oracle E-Business Suite on OCI.

**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Load Balancing Service** - The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Load Balancing service provides automated traffic distribution from one entry point to multiple servers reachable from your virtual cloud network (VCN). The service offers a load balancer with your choice of a public or private IP address, and provisioned bandwidth.

**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** – Combines the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure to deliver high-performance, high availability, and cost-effective infrastructure services.

**Region** – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are hosted in regions, which are located in different metropolitan areas. Regions are completely independent of other regions and can be separated by vast distances – across countries or even continents. Generally, you would deploy an application in the region where it is most heavily used, since using nearby resources is faster than using distant resources.

**Tenancy** – When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle creates a tenancy for your company, which is a secure and isolated partition within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure where you can create, organize, and administer your cloud resources.

**Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** – A virtual version of a traditional network – including subnets, route tables, and gateways – on which your instances run. A cloud network resides within a single region, but can cross multiple availability domains.
