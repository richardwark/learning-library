### About Product/Technology

Lines of business are under enormous pressure to generate more insights, faster, from their financial systems and other critical data sources. But for most organizations, far too much time is spent manually sourcing, managing, preparing, and securing data – leaving far too little time for true analysis and insight.

Oracle Fusion ERP Analytics provides the fastest path to insight with your ERP data, based on its pre-built integration to your ERP Cloud, pre-built data model, and pre-built interfaces – including KPIs, dashboards, and self- service project areas that you can use to easily customize and extend your analysis. And, it’s all built on the foundation of Oracle Analytics Cloud and the self-tuning, self-scaling, self-securing Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Oracle Essbase is a business analytics solution that uses a proven, flexible, best-in-class architecture for analysis, reporting, and collaboration. Essbase delivers instant value and greater productivity for your business users, analysts, modelers, and decision-makers, across all lines of business within your organization.

Oracle Essbase helps you to build your company’s cloud strategy efficiently by avoiding data and business process fragmentation. Oracle Essbase can be easily deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which can then be widely used to solve simple to complex business analytics use cases across all industries. It is designed to help you model business performance levels and deliver what-if analyses for varying conditions. Using Oracle Identity Cloud Service, Essbase can utilize enterprise-wide user profiles to work and integrate with Oracle Cloud.
