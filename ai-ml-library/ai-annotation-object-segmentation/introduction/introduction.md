# Introduction

## About this workshop

Exciting advancements in the AI/ML space are being developed in the area of computer vision. While still in its infancy, some of the tooling and modeling are widely are accessible at an entry level for any development team. All that is required is a general knowledge of code written in Python, a sample data-set, and an idea. In this guide we will take images from the COCO dataset, annotate them using COCO Annotator, and train a model with the data using Detectron2. While the COCO dataset already has annotations available for download, building it yourself will provide an understanding for combining these tools to develop a model for any use case. This guide will focus on common daily objects, but the technique can be applied to detecting car parts in a manufacturing plant, different types of produce in a warehouse, or safety equipment at the job site.

***NOTE:*** The training process can be completed on a CPU-only system, but it will take longer to arrive at a trained model, so a GPU-enabled system is recommended.

Estimated lab time: 3 hours
