    ![](./images/em-stack-plan-2.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-plan-results-1.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-plan-results-2.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-plan-results-3.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-plan-results-4.png " ")

## **Step 3:** Terraform Apply
When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a terraform **plan** and **apply**.  Let's do that now.

1.  At the top of your page, click on **Stack Details**.  Click the button, **Terraform Actions** -> **Apply**.  This will create your network (unless you opted to use and existing VCN) and instance(s) containing a pre-configured Enterprise Manager 13c with running database targets.

    ![](./images/em-stack-details-post-plan.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-apply-1.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-apply-2.png " ")

2.  Once this job succeeds, you will get an apply complete notification from Terraform.  Examine it closely, 8 resources have been added (3 only if using an existing VCN).  Congratulations, your environment is created!  Time to login to your instance and validate before getting started on labs.

    ![](./images/em-stack-apply-results-2.png " ")

    ![](./images/em-stack-apply-results-3.png " ")

## **Step 4:** Connect to your instance

Choose the environment where you created your ssh-key in the previous lab (Generate SSH Keys)
  - *NOTE 1:  If you are using your laptop to connect your corporate VPN may prevent you from logging in.*
  - *NOTE 2: The ssh-daemon is disabled for the up to 5 minutes or so while the instance is processing.  If you are unable to connect and sure you have a valid key, wait a few minutes and try again.*
  - *NOTE 3: It takes about 30 minutes for all Enterprise Manager processes and monitored databases to fully start upon instance creation before you can access the EM console*

### Oracle Cloud Shell

1. To re-start the Oracle Cloud shell, go to your Cloud console and click the cloud shell icon to the right of the region.  *Note: Make sure you are in the region you were assigned*

    ![](./images/em-cloudshell.png " ")

2.  Go to **Compute** -> **Instance** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment)
3.  On the instance homepage, find the Public IP address for your instance.
4.  Enter the command below to login to your instance.    
    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ````

    ![](./images/em-cloudshell-ssh.png " ")

If you used the default RSA key name of **id_rsa** then use the following to connect as there's no need to explicitly specify the key.

````
ssh  opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
````

5.  When prompted, answer **yes** to continue connecting.
6.  Continue to Step 5 on the left hand menu.

### MAC or Windows CYGWIN Emulator
1.  Go to **Compute** -> **Instance** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment)
2.  On the instance homepage, find the Public IP address for your instance.
3.  Open up a terminal (MAC) or cygwin emulator as the opc user.  Enter yes when prompted.

    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ````
    ![](./images/em-mac-linux-ssh-login.png " ")

4.  After successfully logging in, proceed to Step 5.

### Windows using Putty

On Windows, you can use PuTTY as an SSH client. PuTTY enables Windows users to connect to remote systems over the internet using SSH and Telnet. SSH is supported in PuTTY, provides for a secure shell, and encrypts information before it's transferred.

1.  Download and install PuTTY. [http://www.putty.org](http://www.putty.org)
2.  Run the PuTTY program. On your computer, go to **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**
3.  Select or enter the following information:
    - Category: _Session_
    - IP address: _Your service instance’s public IP address_
    - Port: _22_
    - Connection type: _SSH_

    ![](images/7c9e4d803ae849daa227b6684705964c.jpg " ")

#### **Configuring Automatic Login**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Connection and then **Select** Data.

2.  Enter your auto-login username. Enter **opc**.

    ![](images/36164be0029033be6d65f883bbf31713.jpg " ")

#### **Adding Your Private Key**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Auth.
2.  **Click** browse and find the private key file that matches your VM’s public key. This private key should have a .ppk extension for PuTTy to work.

    ![](images/df56bc989ad85f9bfad17ddb6ed6038e.jpg " ")

To save all your settings:

1.  In the category section, **Click** session.
2.  In the saved sessions section, name your session, for example ( EM13C-ABC ) and **Click** Save.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

## Appendix:  Teraform and Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.  In this lab a configuration file has been created for you to build network and compute components.  The compute component you will build creates an image out of Oracle's Cloud Marketplace.  This image is running Oracle Linux 7.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, take a watch the video below.
