# Replicating Data Using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate > Introduction
## Introduction

Oracle GoldenGate, the industry-leading data replication and integration software, is now available as a fully-managed, cloud native service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This workshop guides you through the steps to set up and use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate.

Estimated Lab Time: 2 hours

### What is Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate?
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate is a fully-managed service that uses Oracle GoldenGate Microservices to help you replicate data in real time, at scale, in the cloud. It processes data as it moves from one or more data management systems to target databases in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment
* Register a Database
* Access the GoldenGate Deployment Console
* Create an Extract and a Replicat
* Monitor Extracts and Replicats

### Prerequisites

* Experience with Oracle Database
* Familiarity with Oracle GoldenGate is helpful, but not required
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is helpful, but not required

### Lab Breakdown

* Lab 1: Set Up the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Environment
* Lab 2: Access the GoldenGate Deployment Console
* Lab 3: Create the Extract and Replicat
* Lab 4: Monitor Extracts and Replicats

*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## **STEP 1**: Set up the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Environment

Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## **STEP 2:** title

1. Sub step 1

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy&gt;</copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may proceed to the next lab.
