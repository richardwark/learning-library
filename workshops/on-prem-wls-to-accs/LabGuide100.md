In order to complete the remaining migration labs, we will first create our on-prem application.  We have a pre-created image with an embeded Weblogic Server which will be used for this process.  To import this image, we must first create a network (VNC) that will allow you access into your image and a compartment which will contain your instances.


### **STEP 3**: Create Network and Compartment on OCI
- Click Compute from the Customize Dashboard or from Services. After that from the Menu Click Identity and Compartments. 
  
  ![](images/100/LabGuide100-CreateCompartment.png)

- Click Create Compartments button to create a Compartment called WebLogicLab.
  
  ![](images/100/LabGuide100-CreateCompartment2.png)

- You can see the recently created WebLogicLab Compartment in  Compartments.
  
  ![](images/100/LabGuide100-CreateCompartment3.png)

- Click Compute from the menu and click Custom Images.
  
  ![](images/100/LabGuide100-CustomImages.png)

### **STEP 4**: Import Custom Image

- Click Import Image button and fill name of import image and  **copy** object storage URL.
  https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/0wZwJGDzVjygLdY2mMWO6L32dzCO0CxQ2k-c1T3liMI/n/gse00015058/b/PlaceForImages/o/Nov7JDevImage

   After that, click Import Image.
  
![](images/100/LabGuide100-ImageImport.png)

- You can see your WeblogicOnPrem Image is importing.
  
![](images/100/LabGuide100-ImageImport2.png)

- Later you can is your WeblogicOnPrem Image is up and available to use.
  
![](images/100/LabGuide100-ImageImport3.png)

### **STEP 5**: Create Instance

- From the Custom Images page, select WeblogicOnPrem image and click Create Instance
  
  ![](images/100/CreateInstanceOnImage.png)

- Click Create Instance button after completing required name for the instance.

- If you do not have SSH key file, open a terminal window (by right clicking on the desktop and and selecting Open Terminal) and run each of the following commands, one at a time, pressing Enter between each one. These commands will create a new directory called .oci, generate a new PEM private key, generate the corresponding public key, and copy the public key to the clipboard.
  
  ```bash
mkdir ~/.oci
openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

- You can see your WebLogicLabInstance is provisioning.
  
  ![](images/100/ProvisioningInstance.png)

- Then you can see your instance is up and running.
  
  ![](images/100/RunningInstance.png)

- You can connect to the image instance using the public ip Address (Mac Clients).
  
  Example: vnc://132.145.175.73:5910
  Password: Oracle123

- You can connect to the image instance using the public ip Address (Windows Clients).
  
  If you do not have VNC Viewer, you can download it from here. <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/windows/" target="_trial">Download VNC Viewer</a>.
  
  Enter public ip address and port 5910 as follows.
  ![](images/100/vnc1.png)

  Click continue to connect.
