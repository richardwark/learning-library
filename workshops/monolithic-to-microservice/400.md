# Lab 400: Low Code, Microservice Mobile Development

## Before You Begin
### Objectives
- Create a Mobile Application.
- Access the REST services you deployed in Lab 300 on OKE.
- Deploy the mobile application to your phone (Android based).

### Introduction

In this lab you will use Oracle Visual Builder which is a cloud-based software development Platform as a Service (PaaS) and a hosted environment for your application development infrastructure. It provides an open-source standards-based solution to develop, collaborate on, and deploy applications within Oracle Cloud. You will build on the previous labs using the REST points exposed by the AlphaOffice application to OKE in Lab 300.

## Required Artifacts

- Lab 300 needs to be completed with the Product REST application deployed.

- Use Chrome browser works best in it

    ![](images/400/48.PNG " ")

## **STEP 4**: Configure Main page with all products information

1. Click on Variables and then click on **+Variable** to create new variable. Here we are creating variable to store all the product information we fetch from the rest endpoint. Give some meaningful name like getProducts and make sure type is **Service Data Provider** and then click **Create**

    ![](images/400/49.PNG " ")

2. Once the variable is created on the left hand panel click **Select Endpoint**

    ![](images/400/50.PNG " ")

3. Under Service Connections select the get /list which will fetch all the products.

    ![](images/400/51.PNG " ")

4. We already imported a variable type with the application so we can click on **Use Existing Type** and  select **getProducts** and then click **Finish**.

    ![](images/400/52.PNG " ")

5. Once endpoint is configured variable will look something as below image. We need to provide **Key Attributes** which is **product_id** in this variable.

    ![](images/400/53.PNG " ")

6. Go to **Designer Tab** and here you can now see the products are displayed.

    ![](images/400/54.PNG " ")


## **STEP 5**: Configure details page to show product details

1. In this step we are configuring product details page where we can see information of single product. For that we need to configure the page with REST Endpoint to fetch the single record.

2. Click on **main-get-id-detail** under pages Then click on Flag icon which is Actions. Click on **loadGetidChain**

    ![](images/400/55-1.png " ")

3. There click on **Call REST Endpoint** and finally click on **Select Endpoint**.

    ![](images/400/55-2.png " ")

4. Click on **Service Connections** and select product endpoint with **get /{id}**. Click Select

    ![](images/400/56.PNG " ")

5. Once endpoint is configured, you will see the details. Here we need to map Input Parameter ID which is tell our REST Endpoint which product we want information about.

6. Click on **Assign** button aligned with Input Paramaters

    ![](images/400/57.PNG " ")

7. Drag getIdId from Sources to id in Target. Click **Save**
  
    ![](images/400/58.gif " ")

8. At this point to test the application so far, click on Play button in Navigation Bar 

    ![](images/400/59.PNG " ")

## **STEP 6**: Configure request more info page to submit product information request

1. In this Step we will configure request more info page.

2. If you click on **main-request-info** and then **Designer** tab. We can see the form. Our main goal for this step is to configure the Submit Button so that we can post the request information using POST REST Endpoint.

    ![](images/400/60.png " ")

3. Click on **Actions** tab.

    ![](images/400/61.png " ")

4. Under **Actions** page click on **SubmitButtonActionChain**
