## Oracle Integration Cloud Workshop

Welcome to the Oracle Integration Cloud workshop. 
Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) Service provides native connectivity to Oracle and non-Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS) and On-premises  applications, such as Oracle ERP Cloud, Oracle Service Cloud, HCM Cloud, Salesforce, Workday, EBS,SAP, NetSuite and so on. 

OIC adapters simplify connectivity by handling the underlying complexities of connecting to applications using industry-wide best practices. You only need to create a connection that provides minimal connectivity information for each system.


## STORYLINE AND PERSONAS
This use case explores the use of OIC with ERP Cloud Import Bulk Data services with File-based Data Integration (FBDI) compliant files in order to import ERP data such as Journal Entries,Billing Transactions etc. to the respective ERP pillar using processes in ERP Cloud.
