# Data Preparation Using SQL Developer

![](images/200/Picture200-lab.png)  
Updated: October 8, 2019

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to upload the required datasets to the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) instance that you provisioned in the previous lab. You will use SQL Developer as an interface to the ADW instance for uploading and preparing the dataset.

## Objectives
-   Learn how to connect to your new Autonomous Data Warehouse
-   Learn how to load the required datasets to the ADW instance
-   Learn how to prepare datasets for training, validating and applying the machine learning models

## Required Artifacts
-   The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through signing up for a Free Tier account, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

-   Oracle SQL Developer (see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html" target="\_blank"> Oracle Technology Network download site</a>) - Please use the latest version of SQL Developer version as this version contains enhancements for key Autonomous Data Warehouse features, including using ADW behind a VPN or Firewall.  At time of update, the version of SQL Developer available for download is 19.2.


# Connect to ADW and Prepare Data Using SQL Developer

## Part 1. Connect SQL Developer to the ADW instance
In this section you will connect the SQL Developer to the ADW instance that you provisioned in Lab 100.


### **STEP 1: Download the Connection Wallet**
As ADW only accepts secure connections to the database, you need to download a wallet file containing your credentials first. The wallet can be downloaded either from the instance's details page, or from the ADW service console. In this case, we will be showing you how to download the wallet file from the instance's details page.

-   Go back to the Cloud Console and open the Instances screen. Find your database, click the action menu and select **DB Connection**.

-   Under Download a Connection Wallet, click **Download**.

![](./images/200/Picture200-15.jpg)

-   Specify a password of your choice for the wallet. You will need this password when connecting to the database via SQL Developer later, and is also used as the JKS keystore password for JDBC applications that use JKS for security. Click **Download** to download the wallet file to your client machine. Download the wallet to a location you can easily access, because we will be using it in the next step.
*Note: If you are prevented from downloading your Connection Wallet, it may be due to your browser's pop-blocker. Please disable it or create an exception for Oracle Cloud domains.*

### **STEP 2: Connect to the database using SQL Developer**
Start SQL Developer and create a connection for your database using the default administrator account 'ADMIN' by following these steps.

-   Click the **New Connection** icon in the Connections toolbox on the top left of the SQL Developer homepage.

![](./images/200/snap0014653.jpg)

-   Fill in the connection details as below:

-   **Connection Name:** admin_high

-   **Username:** admin

-   **Password:** The password you specified during provisioning your instance

-   **Connection Type:** Cloud Wallet

-   **Configuration File:** Enter the full path for the wallet file you downloaded before, or click the **Browse button** to point to the location of the file.

-   **Service:** There are 3 pre-configured database services for each database. Pick **&lt;databasename&gt;_high** for this lab. For
example, if you the database you created was named adwfinance, select adwfinance_high as the service.

*Note* : SQL Developer versions prior to 18.3 ask for a **Keystore Password.** Here, you would enter the password you specified when downloading the wallet from ADW.

-   Test your connection by clicking the **Test** button, if it succeeds save your connection information by clicking **Save**, then connect to your database by clicking the **Connect** button. An entry for the new connection appears under Connections.

-   If you are behind a VPN or Firewall and this Test fails, make sure you have <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html" target="\_blank">SQL Developer 18.3</a> or higher. This version and above will allow you to select the "Use HTTP Proxy Host" option for a Cloud Wallet type connection. While creating your new ADW connection here, provide your proxy's Host and Port. If you are unsure where to find this, you may look at your computer's connection settings or contact your Network Administrator.




## Part 2. Load Datasets to the ADW Instance

### **STEP 3: Load Datasets to the ADW Instance**

-   Use the SQLDeveloper to import the [station_info.csv](./files/datasets/station_info.csv) dataset to a table (Station_Info) in the database.

-   Use the SQLDeveloper to import the [station_status_weather.csv](./files/datasets/station_status_weather.csv) dataset to a table (Station_Status_Weather) in the database. Make sure the LAST_REPORTED column is created as a TIMESTAMP type column with the following format: DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS (Note that this table has ~1M rows, so it may take about 30mins to import the table using the SQL Developer wizard.)



### **STEP 4: Grant Privileges to the OML User to Access Datasets**
In order to avoid running into an access error when you run the code in OML, grant all privleges to the OML user for the tables you created in the database.

-   Under your connection in the SQL Developer, right-click on **Station_Info** table, select **Privileges** and then select **Grant**.

![](./images/200/Picture200-41.png)

-   In the popped screen, select your OML user in the **Uers/Roles** field, mark **Grant ALL** option and click on **Apply**.

![](./images/200/Picture200-42.png)

-   You should see a message indicating that your action was successful. Repeat the same steps to also grant privileges on the table **Station_Status_Weather**.

### **STEP 5: Prepare the Data for Training ML Models in OAC**

-   Copy and paste the code snipper in [data_prep.sql](./files/scripts/data_prep.sql) file to your SQL Developer worksheet and run the script. This code prepares the portion of data that you will need for training an ML model in OAC .
