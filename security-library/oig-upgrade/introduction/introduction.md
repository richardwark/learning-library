Oracle Identity Governance is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages users' access privileges within enterprise IT resources. Its flexible architecture easily handles the most uncompromising and rigorous IT and business requirements -- without requiring changes to existing infrastructure, policies or procedures. Oracle Identity Governance is designed to manage user access privileges across all of a firm's resources, throughout the entire identity management lifecycle -- from initial creation of access privileges to dynamically adapting to changes in business requirements.
