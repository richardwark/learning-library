# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Identity Governance(OIG) is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages user's access privileges within enterprise IT resources. Oracle Identity Role Intelligence(OIRI) is a new microservice available as part of OIG suite is an intelligent, automated and flexible way of optimizing role-based access control (RBAC). This Workshop provides hands on experience in deploying OIRI, importing data from OIG, performing role mining and publishing roles into OIG from OIRI.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 2 hours

### About Product/Technology

Oracle Identity Role Intelligence is an intelligent, automated, and flexible way to optimize role-based access control (RBAC). OIRI is a containerized microservice and is an extension to Oracle Identity Governance (OIG). You can deploy the microservice on-premises or on the Cloud. It can be deployed on Kubernetes containers for your on-premises landscape.
The key capabilities of OIRI include:
  - Discovery of entitlements patterns across peer groups
  - Support for top-down approach for role mining based on user attributes, or for bottom-up approach that filters data based on applications and entitlements, or a hybrid approach
  - Compare candidate roles with existing roles to avoid role explosion
  - Ability to fine tune the candidate roles based on user affinity and role affinity
  - Automated publishing of roles to OIG to trigger workflow for role adoption
  - Ability to merge data from different sources, such as OIG database and flat files and provide what-if analysis before moving candidate roles to production

### Objectives

In this Workshop, you will:
* Deploy OIRI in the local Kubernetes node
* Import data into OIRI from OIG
* Perform Role Mining and Analyze Candidate Roles
* Publish role into OIG
