# Enabling Conditional MFA in IDCS

## Introduction

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method of authentication that requires the use of more than one factor to verify a user’s identity.

With MFA enabled in Oracle Identity Cloud Service, when a user signs in to an application, they are prompted for their user name and password, which is the first factor – something that they know. The user is then required to provide a second type of verification. This is called 2-Step Verification. The two factors work together to add an additional layer of security by using either additional information or a second device to verify the user’s identity and complete the login process.

Users are increasingly connected, accessing their accounts and applications from anywhere. As an administrator, when you add MFA on top of the traditional user name and password, that helps you to protect access to data and applications. This also reduces the likelihood of online identity theft and fraud, which secures your business applications even if an account password is compromised.


Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* select MFA factors that you want to enable

## **STEP 1**: Enable MFA Factors

* *Personas*:
    - Administrator

1. Login into IDCS Admin console as an administrator:

    ```
    https://<your tenant>/ui/v1/adminconsole
    ```
2.	Navigate to *Security* and select *MFA*.

3.	Select the *MFA factors* that you want to enable and then click on *Save*.

## **STEP 2**: Define a Sign-On Policy for Salesforce

* *Personas*:
    - Administrator

A sign-on policy allows identity domain administrators, security administrators, and application administrators to define criteria that Oracle Identity Cloud Service uses to determine whether to allow a user to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service or prevent a user from accessing Oracle Identity Cloud Service.

Oracle Identity Cloud Service provides you with a default sign-on policy that contains a default sign-on rule. Oracle Identity Cloud Service evaluates the criteria of the rule for any user attempting to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. By default, this rule allows all users to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. This means whichever authentication the user uses, either local authentication, by supplying a user name and password, or authentication by using an external identity provider, will be sufficient.

However, you can build upon this policy by adding other sign-on rules to it. By adding these rules, you can prevent some of your users from signing in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. Or, you can allow them to sign in, but prompt them for an additional factor to access resources that are protected by Oracle Identity Cloud Service, such as the My Profile console or the Identity Cloud Service console.


1.	Navigate to *Security* and then select *Network Perimeters*.

    ![Image](images/L5002.png)

    ```
    A network perimeter contains a list of IP addresses.

    After creating a network perimeter, you can prevent users from signing in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service if they use one of the IP addresses in the network perimeter. This is known as blacklisting. A blacklist contains IP addresses or domains that are suspicious. As an example, a user may be trying to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service with an IP address that comes from a country where hacking is rampant.

    You can also configure Oracle Identity Cloud Service so that users can log in, using only IP addresses contained in the network perimeter. This is known as whitelisting, where users who attempt to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service with these IP addresses will be accepted. Whitelisting is the reverse of blacklisting, the practice of identifying IP addresses that are suspicious, and as a result, will be denied access to Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
    ```

2.	Click on *Add* to add a new Network Perimeter. Enter an IP range as shown below. For now, put a dummy range or even a dummy address (e.g 10.0.0.0), so that no authentication is denied and click *Save*.

3.	Navigate to *Security* and select *Sign On policies*. To define a Sign-On-Policy for the Salesforce App click on *Add*.

    ![Image](images/L5004.png)

    ```
    Note that a Default Sign-On Policy exists and is enabled by default. The default policy applies to all application that have not been explicitly mapped to a sign on policy.
    ```

4. Enter a *Policy Name* and *Description* in the Details section and click on *>* button to move to the next section.

    ![Image](images/L5005.png)

5.	In the *Sign-On Rules* section click on *Add Rules* to add a new rule.

    ![Image](images/L5006.png)

6.	Create a rule to prompt for MFA when a user belongs to the Employees group. Ensure following parameters are set:

    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Rule Name | MFA for Employees |
    | And is a member of these Groups | Employee |
    | Prompt for additional Factor | Checked |
    | Enrollment | Optional |
    | Frequency of additional factor when using a trusted device | Once per Session |

7. Click *Save* in order to save the rule

    ![Image](images/L5007.png)

8.	Click *Add* to add a second rule.

    ![Image](images/L5008.png)

9.	Ensure following parameters are set:

    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Rule Name | Blacklisted IP |
    | And user’s client IP address is | In one or more of these networks Blacklisted IP’s |
    | Access is | Denied |

10. Click *Save* in order to save the rule

    ![Image](images/L5009.png)

    ```
    Note the Sign-On Rules are ordered. The actions (allow/deny/prompt for MFA) are determined by the first rule where the conditions match. If none of the rule conditions match the default action is deny.
    ```

11.	To move the *Blacklisted IP* rule to the top click on the reorder icon and drag the rule to the top. Click *Finish*.

    ![Image](images/L5010.png)

    ```
    The above rules are evaluated as below

    a. if user access is from a blacklisted IP the deny access.
    b. if user is a member of Salesforce Employee group, then prompt for MFA once per session.
    c. for all other users deny access.
    ```

12.	Click on the *Apps* tab and click on the *Assign* button.

    ![Image](images/L5011.png)

13.	Select the *Salesforce* application and click *OK*.

    ![Image](images/L5012.png)

14.	Salesforce has been successfully added to the Sign-On Policy.

    ![Image](images/L5013.png)

15.	Navigate back to *Sign-On Policies* and click on *Activate* in order to activate the *Salesforce* policy.

## **STEP 4**: Block access via policy

* *Personas*:
    - Administrator

    ```
    Block blacklisted IPs
    After creating a network perimeter, you can prevent users from signing in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service if they use one of the IP addresses in the network perimeter. This is known as blacklisting. A blacklist contains IP addresses or domains that are suspicious. As an example, a user may be trying to sign in to Oracle Identity Cloud Service with an IP address that comes from a country where hacking is rampant.
    ```

1.	Navigate to *Security* and select *Network Perimeters*. Click the menu on the right of the Blacklisted IPs Network Perimeter you created earlier and click Edit. The previously configured dummy IP address will be shown.

    ![Image](images/L5027.png)

2.	Change the dummy IP to your IP range:
* Open a web browser and access a website that shows your *public IP address*, for example: https://www.whatismyip.com/
* Copy your public IP address.
* Go back to IDCS and replace the dummy IP address with your public IP address and click *Save*.

    ![Image](images/L5028.png)

## **STEP 5**: Test the updated policy  

* *Personas*:
    - End User

1.	Sign in to IDCS console with a user account that has been assigned to the Salesforce application.

2.	Click on the *Salesforce Chatter* tile.

    ![Image](images/L5029.png)

3.	You will denied access, given that your request originates in a blacklisted IP.
